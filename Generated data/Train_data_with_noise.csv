50,Varicose Veins,"I have a rash on my legs that is causing a lot of discomforts. It seems there is a cramp and I can see prominent veins on the calf. Also, I have been feeling very tired and fatigued in the past couple of days.","""Oh dear... I've got this rash on my legs, you see. Been botherin' me somethin' fierce. Crampy feelin', like my calf's all contracted. And them veins, oh boy! You can practically see 'em stickin' out. Now, let me think... when did I get this? Um, was it last week or the one before? Doesn't matter, I suppose. Anyway, it's been botherin' me for a bit now.

""By the way, I remember my cousin Edna had somethin' similar once. She said it was from walkin' too much in them new shoes. (chuckles) Poor thing... I swear, her feet were more trouble than a sack full of cats!

""Now where was I? Ah yes, tiredness. Been feelin' rather... exhausted lately. Not just my legs neither! All over. Don't know what's gotten into me. Must be this heat... or maybe I'm just gettin' old.""","Oh dear doctor... I'm so glad you're here. You know, I was trying to get some gardening done yesterday, but my knees just won't cooperate no more. (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, this rash on my legs. It's been bothering me something awful. My granddaughter was over visiting the other day and she said it looked like varicose veins or something... I don't know if that's what it is, but it's all red and swollen. And let me tell you, it aches! (chuckles) Reminds me of when my husband used to have those sciatica issues... poor man was always complaining about his back.

Anyway... where was I? Oh yes, the rash. It's been on for a couple of days now, I think. (pauses, looks around) You know, I was at the grocery store yesterday and saw one of those new-fangled shopping carts with all the gadgets and gizmos on it... I don't know how people use 'em! (laughs)

But anyway, back to this rash. My leg cramps up something awful when I stand up from sitting too long... like now. And I can see these prominent veins on my calf. It's a bit disconcerting, if you ask me. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time my cousin Edna had varicose veins? She had to have surgery... or was it just her sister Margaret? (laughs)

Oh dear me! Where am I going with this story? Ah yes, fatigue. Been feeling so tired lately. Just can't seem to get enough sleep no matter how long I rest. Even when I'm in bed, I feel all groggy and lethargic... you know what I mean? Like my batteries are running low or something! (laughs)"
51,Varicose Veins,"My calves have been cramping up when I walk or stand for long periods of time. There are bruise marks on my calves, which is making me worried. I feel tired very soon.","My calves have been crampin' up somethin' fierce when I walk or stand for long periods of time... You know, I was at the grocery store yesterday and saw that new girl workin', couldn't tell you her name, but she had a nice smile. Anyway, my legs... Yeah, they start crampin' after about 20 minutes or so, could be less, might be more... Uh, what's that one doctor I was seein' last week? Oh right, Dr. Smith! He said somethin' about... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my legs. There are these bruise marks on 'em now, which is makin' me pretty worried, if I'm honest with you. And then there's the tiredness... It hits me outta nowhere, like a wall comin' at ya. (chuckles) Now where's my tea?","Oh boy, doc... my calves, you see... they've been acting up somethin' fierce... crampin' when I walk or stand for too long... (pauses) I think it started after that trip to Florida last year? Or was it the year before? Oh dear, those cruise ships can be quite a workout, I suppose. (chuckles)

Anyway, my calves... they get all tight and achy... like someone's stickin' needles in 'em. And then there are these bruises, doc... (pauses) Where did I put that picture of my grandkids? Ah yes, now where was I? Oh right! The bruises on my calves, they're quite nasty, if you ask me. Makes me worried sick. What if it's somethin' serious?

And then there's the tiredness... (yawns) excuse me, doc... I get so exhausted just walkin' to the kitchen for a glass of water... or standin' in line at the post office... (pauses) You know what they used to say about my grandma? She was always runnin' errands till she was 80 years young! (laughs)

But, doc, I think it's more than just gettin' old, if you catch my drift. I mean, I'm not 20 no more... but still... these cramps and bruises... they're really gettin' to me. And don't even get me started on the pain in my lower back... (pauses) Now what was that medication we were discussin'? Ah yes, the one for arthritis! No, wait, I think it was for my hip replacement? Oh dear...

Anyway, doc... like I said, my calves... they're just crampin' and bruisin' somethin' awful. (sighs)"
52,Varicose Veins,"There is bruising on my legs that I cannot explain. I can see strange blood vessels below the skin. Also, I am slightly obese and I am really worried.","""Doc... or is it nurse? Anyway, I'm concerned about these bruises on my legs. They just showed up out of nowhere, I swear. I mean, I've had a few scrapes here and there, but not like this. And have you seen the blood vessels underneath my skin? They're all twisted and whatnot... makes me think of that time I went fishing with Ed, and he got a nasty gash on his leg... anyway... the bruises. I was at the grocery store yesterday, or was it last week? Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up... and I saw my grandkids playing outside, they were running around like lunatics... (chuckles) Ah yes, the bruises! I'm worried 'cause I've been taking these new meds for my blood pressure, but maybe it's something else entirely. And I am a bit... plump, you know? Not that it matters at my age... (pauses) What were we talking about again?""","I don't know what's goin' on with these bruises... (pauses) You see, I was out gardenin' yesterday, and I think I must've gotten a bit scratched on them thorns... no, wait, that wasn't it. I just saw my niece's picture, you know, the one who got married last year? Ah, what was I sayin'? Oh right! The bruises. (pauses again) Anyway, they're on both legs, and I've been wincin' when I walk.

There are these... (taps leg) veins or somethin', right under the skin. You can see 'em, all dark and whatnot. My daughter said it's nothin' to worry about, but I'm worried! Can't help feelin' like somethin's wrong. (mutters to self) Used to be when you got sick, you just took some castor oil... or was that for indigestion?

And, oh boy, my legs... they're a bit more rounded than I'd like 'em to be, if you know what I mean. I've been tryin' to get back into them exercises... but it's hard when your knees ache somethin' fierce! (sighs) Got all these pills for that, but... anyway. Like I was sayin', this bruising business has got me spooked. (pauses once more)

You see, my grandmother used to get those spider veins... no, wait, that's not what it was called... the one where your skin gets all saggy? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old! (laughs)"
53,Varicose Veins,I am overweight and have noticed that my legs are swollen and the blood vessels are visible. My legs have swollen and I can see a stream of swollen veins on my calves.,"You know, I was just at the Early Bird Special yesterday... or was it last week? Anyway, the special was fried chicken, can't remember how good it was though. (pauses) Oh, right, my legs. They're all puffy, like water balloons, you see 'em in the mirror and think ""what's going on here?"" Got some of them varicose veins too, just poppin' out like snakes on my calves. My sister had those when she was younger... or maybe it was my cousin? (chuckles) Time gets away from me sometimes. I've been eatin' a lot more lately, maybe that's the problem. All this swelling in my legs, makes me think of my brother's wife, her mother used to have something with her feet too... now what was it again?","Oh dear... legs, yes... swellin' up somethin' fierce. Can't even fit into my good pair of shoes no more. And them blood vessels... Lord have mercy... you can see 'em like a road map! I swear, it's like someone took a marker and drew all those little lines on me.

Swollen veins, that's what the nurse at the... uh... where was I? Oh yes, the pharmacy said. She said they call it varicose veins or somethin'. But I always thought that was just a fancy name for when you get too old to walk no more. (chuckles) No, no, I remember now, she said it's because of all them extra pounds... weight gain, and the lack of... uh... what was it? Ah yes! Movement. Not exercisin' enough.

Now, my legs, they feel like lead weights when I try to walk. And the skin on 'em is all wrinkly and stretchy. Like a piece of worn-out leather. I used to have those stockings with the little seams, you know? They were nice and smooth... (pauses) Wait, where's my glasses? I think I left 'em in the other room... anyway...

Oh dearie me! My legs are all puffy like a big ol' pillow. And when I sit down, they start to hurt somethin' awful. Like someone took a hammer and just... whack! (laughs nervously) Oh my goodness, where's that nice lady nurse? I want her to give me some of them... uh... creams or pills. Something to make it all go away."
54,Varicose Veins,"The veins on my calves have become very prominent and causing discomfort. I can't stand for long periods of time, as it causes pain in my legs, similar to cramps.","""Doc... I think it started... um... how long ago was it? Last winter? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Anyway, my legs have been actin' up somethin' fierce. Veins on my calves, they're like... well, you know when you get a big ol' bruise after a fall? It's like that, but all over. And it hurts, dear me... can't stand for too long without feelin' like I'm gonna... (pauses) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The pain. Like cramps, but not exactly. More like... well, you know how sometimes your legs just go dead on you? That's what it feels like all the time now.""","I don't know if I'm explainin' this right, but... my legs, well, they're actin' up somethin' fierce. You see, I was just watchin' TV yesterday, and I think it was... was it that new show with the nice young fella? No, not him, the other one... (pauses) Ah yes, The Golden Girls! I love them, by the way. They always make me laugh.

Anyway, where was I? Oh right, my legs. So, I noticed these veins on my calves are stickin' out somethin' awful. It's like they're callin' attention to themselves, if you know what I mean. And it hurts, oh boy, it really does. (chuckles) I remember when I used to walk five miles a day without breakin' a sweat... or at least, not too much of one. Nowadays, just standin' up straight for a bit gives me the same feelin' as gettin' a cramp in my leg.

You know, I think it might've started after that big storm we had last week? Or was it two weeks ago? (laughs) Oh dear, I get those dates mixed up sometimes. My mind's like a... well, you know what they say about old brains and watermelons! (chuckles)

Where was I? Ah yes, the pain in my legs. It's more of a crampy feelin', if that makes sense. Like when your muscles are all knotted up and you just wanna jump around to loosen 'em up. But now it's more like... well, I don't know how to describe it, but it's not pleasant. And it's gettin' worse by the day, so... I reckon I should probably do somethin' about it, don't you think? (pauses) Now, where did I put my reading glasses?"
55,Varicose Veins,The skin around the veins on my legs is red and inflamed. I believe I can see some of the swollen blood vessels. I am really worried about it.,"Oh dear, doc... um, I think it started a few weeks ago? Maybe after that trip to visit my sister in Florida? Anyway, the skin around my veins on my legs, it's all red and inflamed like. And I can see those big swollen blood vessels just under the surface. It's really bothering me, if you know what I mean. I've been taking care of myself, eating my veggies... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw that snake in the backyard? No, no, focus... (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway, it's just not right. I was at the store yesterday and I saw those young folks with their fancy walking shoes on, and I thought to myself, ""What's wrong with my old legs?"" (pauses again) Ah yes, so this redness and swelling... I'm worried something might be wrong.","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... I mean, I've got this thing on my legs, see? The skin around these veins is all red and inflamed like... like a burn or somethin'. And them blood vessels, they're swollen up like sausages. I can see 'em, yeah, it's like they're visible under the skin now. (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh right...

I remember my mother used to get varicose veins or somethin', and she'd have to wear them stockings... what were they called? Ah yes, support hose! She swore by 'em. (chuckles) But this is different, doc... I think it's the same thing, though.

Now, where was I? Oh yeah! The redness. It's been gettin' worse over the past week or so. And it hurts, too – achy pain when I walk around. I'm worried sick about it, if you know what I mean... (trails off) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She had a heart condition... I think it was her heart, anyway.

Anyway, like I said, the skin is all red and inflamed, and them blood vessels are just... wow! It's like I can see 'em wigglin' under the surface. (laughs nervously) Am I goin' crazy or what? (pauses again) No, no, this is serious business. I know it is..."
56,Varicose Veins,Standing or walking for long periods of time causes a lot of pain in my legs. I get cramps upon doing physical activities. There are bruise marks on my legs too.,"""Oh dear... I've been having some troubles with my legs lately. You see, walking for long periods of time... (pauses) Ah yes, like when I went to the store last week... anyway... it causes a lot of pain in my legs. Can't even walk to the mailbox without wincin'. And then there's these cramps... (hesitates) Oh, what was that medicine my grandson took for his crampy thing? You know, with the muscle part... uh... (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, cramps. They come when I do physical activities, like gardening or mowin' the lawn. And then there are these bruise marks on my legs too... (pauses again) Don't rightly recall how they got there, but... (trails off)""","Oh dearie me... (pauses) Ah, yes, the pain in my legs. You see, doc... (chuckles) I'm not as spry as I used to be. Can't even walk around the block without... (hesitates) what was it? Oh yes! The cramps. Terrible cramps. Like someone's squeezing my muscles with a pair of pliers. (pauses again) And these bruises, they just keep appearing out of nowhere. (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I fell down the stairs at my sister's house? No, no, it wasn't on your wife's birthday... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I saying?

Oh yes! The pain in my legs. It's like a knife through my muscles when I stand for too long. And walking? Forget about it. (pauses to collect thoughts) I swear, I must've walked more miles than I'm old enough to have... (laughs) Ah, the good old days! You know, I used to be able to walk from here to there without breaking a sweat. But now... (sighs) Now it's like my legs are made of lead.

You see, doc, I think it's because... (pauses, searching for words) You know that big hill on Elm Street? The one with the lovely azaleas in springtime? (starts to ramble) Did I tell you about those azaleas? My goodness gracious, they're still blooming strong even after all these years! But what was I saying? Ah yes! That hill. It's too steep for me nowadays... (trails off)

Oh dear me, where did I put my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table... (pauses to look around) Anyway... as I was saying, doc... that pain in my legs just won't quit. And those bruises, they're just a nuisance. Like a pesky little fly buzzing around my head all day long... (trails off again)

Oh dearie me! I hope I'm making sense, doc. I get so mixed up sometimes... (sighs)"
57,Varicose Veins,The cramps in my calves are making it difficult for me to walk. I feel fatigued after working for some time. I believe obesity is the reason behind this.,"You know, doc... *coughs* Excuse me, I'm gettin' these cramps in my calves now, makin' it tough to walk around the house, you know? Can't even take a stroll without feelin' like I got lead weights in my legs. And after I work in the garden for a bit, I'm plumb tuckered out... *pauses* Now what was the name of that one fella who had them cramps all the time? You know, my cousin's brother-in-law, Ed... or was it Ernie? Anyway, anyway... I swear it's this weight, doc. Obesity, that's the ticket. I mean, I'm not as spry as I used to be, but still... *chuckles* My sister said I should try them new shoes with arch support, but I dunno if they'd help...","I'm havin' a time walkin', ya know? My legs... (pauses) where was I? Ah yes, my legs are achin'. These cramps in my calves, they're gettin' worse and worse. It's like my muscles are tryin' to tell me somethin'. Fatigued, that's the word. After I work in the garden for a bit, (chuckles) I'm plumb tuckered out.

Now, I was talkin' to my sister the other day... or was it my brother? Anyway, she said somethin' about... what was it? Ah yes! She said maybe it's that new medication I'm takin'. But I don't think so. No sirree, I'm pretty sure it's just bein' a bit... well-rounded. (laughs) You know how we used to call myself a little heavy. Obesity, they call it now.

Oh boy, where was I? Ah yes! These cramps! They're like... have you ever had one of them charley horses? No, no, it's not that. This is different. It's like my muscles are just... tired, I reckon. (pauses) You know what might be helpful? A nice long walk. But wait, no... (laughs) That wouldn't work too well if I'm gettin' cramps just from walkin', would it?

(pauses, looks around the room) Now, what was the other thing my sister said? Ah yes! She mentioned somethin' about... exercise! Maybe I should start exercisin' more. But that's hard when you're feelin' so... (pauses again) fatigued. Yeah, that's it. Fatigued."
58,Varicose Veins,"The swelling in my legs has gotten worse over the past few weeks. Now, a large number of veins are noticeable on my calves, which is making me worried.","Oh dear...my legs, they're all swollen now. Been gettin' worse, I think. No, wait, was it three weeks? Four? Can't rightly remember... (pauses) My neighbor Mrs. Jenkins has the same problem, you know. Got a big ol' vein on her ankle, just like me. (chuckles) Anyway, my legs...there's lots of 'em now. Veins, I mean. Big and blue, they are. On my calves mostly. (pauses again) It started after that trip to the beach last month, I'm sure of it. Heat's not good for these old bones, no sirree...I was thinkin' maybe it's from walkin' too much? Nah, can't be...must've been somethin' else... (trails off)","I don't know if I should've had that second cup of coffee this morning... (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway... My legs, they're just... you know how it is when your feet swell up at night? Yeah, well mine been doing that for weeks now, and it's getting worse. Can't even fit into my favorite slippers no more. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the beach with my husband back in '62? We met some nice folks... anyway...

Oh right, my legs! So, I've been noticing these big veins on my calves, all prominent like... makes me think of those fancy cars they show on TV. (laughs) No, no, no, not that at all. What I mean is, they're very noticeable now. Not just a few, either – it's like there are dozens of 'em! Makes me worried sick. You know, my sister-in-law used to have something with her veins too... I think she had surgery? (hesitates) Could've been a different relative...

I'm telling you, Doc's office always says the same thing: ""Just elevate your legs and drink more water."" (sarcastically) Oh sure, that'll fix it. Easier said than done! Can't even walk without these... what did they call 'em? Varicose something-or-others? (pauses again) Wait, where was I going this morning? Ah yes... So, the swelling's gotten so bad, I'm starting to feel a bit... anxious about it. Like I said, makes me worry."
59,Varicose Veins,The veins on my legs are very noticeable and cause me discomfort. It seems like there is a major bruise and I get cramps when I run.,"""Doc... (pauses) Oh, you know, I was talking to my friend Edna yesterday... about her knee surgery... and she said it took months to heal up... anyway, like I said, these veins on my legs... they're just so noticeable now... always have been, but lately... (hesitates) excuse me, what's that noise? Ah, never mind. Like I was saying, these veins, they ache a bit... and I get these cramps when I run... which isn't often anymore... (chuckles) no more running for me... used to love it, though. My husband said I was like the Energizer Bunny back in the day... (trails off) Oh dear, what's my name supposed to be doing? Ah yes... veins... anyway, there's a bruise-like thing on the inside of my leg, too... and my legs just feel all sore now.""","I'm not sure if I should be telling you this, but... (pauses) Oh dear, my legs have been acting up something awful lately. You see, I was just walking down the hallway yesterday and I saw a picture of me when I was younger... (chuckles) No, no, that's not important now.

Anyway, these veins on my legs... they're so big and blue, like ropes. My daughter said they looked like varicose veins or something, but I don't know what that means. It doesn't hurt all the time, but when I run... (pauses again) Oh boy, when I used to run in my day! (laughs) We didn't have all these new-fangled shoes and whatnot, no sir.

Anyway, it's this cramping sensation, like someone's pinching my legs. And sometimes there's this big bruise, right here... (taps leg) No, not exactly here, but you know what I mean. My husband always says I'm just being a worrier, but I know something's wrong. My sister had a similar problem once... or was it my brother? (pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the veins! So they're like big knots under my skin and sometimes they feel like they're on fire. It's quite uncomfortable when I'm standing for long periods. Or sitting, even. But especially standing. You see... (trails off)"
60,Varicose Veins,The skin on my calves has become inflamed and red. My legs hurt if I try to run or do any physical activities.,"""You see, doc... my skin on my calves, it's all inflamed and red now. Can't even believe I'm sayin' this at my age. I mean, I was walkin' down the street yesterday, and I saw that young fella, what's-his-name, you know, Jimmy... no, that's not right, it was Bobby! Anyway, he was doin' those yoga poses, and I thought to myself, 'I can still do that.' But now, my legs hurt somethin' fierce if I try to run or even just walk too fast. It's like someone's stabbin' me with a knife. Now, let me think... what day was it yesterday? Ah, yes! Tuesday... I'm sure it was Tuesday. Anyway, the pain's been gettin' worse since... um... last week? No, that can't be right. Oh dear, my brain's goin'!""","You know, Doc... (pauses) I don't know what's going on with me lately... (hesitates) Oh, wait, where was I? Ah yes, my legs. They're just... (struggling to find the right word) inflamed, I think that's the word. Red, like a tomato or something. (chuckles) Tomatoes! My wife used to make the best tomato soup when we were first married...

(Trails off for a moment)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my legs. They hurt if I try to run or... or do anything physical. (pauses again) You know what's funny? When I was in the war... (starts to tell an unrelated story) Oh boy, we used to have to march for miles and miles, and our boots were always soaked through. Reminds me of my cousin Edna, she loved those long walks with her husband...

(Suddenly refocuses)

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my legs! They hurt if I walk too far or run... (tries to think of an example) or even just get up from the couch sometimes. It's like they're on fire, but not quite. You know how sometimes your skin gets all itchy and... (stops suddenly)

Now what was that thing I had a few years ago? (pauses, searching for a memory) Oh yes! My knees! That was a whole other story. But these calves, they're just... (frowns) inflamed, like I said.

(Tries to summarize) So, if I'm being honest with you, Doc, it's been going on for a while now... since the winter, I think? We had all that snow and ice, and my poor joints have just never been the same."
61,Varicose Veins,"Recently, the pain in my calves has been constant and becomes worse when I stand or walk for long periods of time. My legs have started to swell and also some blood vessels are quite noticeable.","You know, doc... my legs, they've been actin' up somethin' fierce lately... (pauses) Oh, I remember that one time I went fishing with Edna and her husband at Lake Michigan... beautiful day, caught a big ol' walleye... anyway...(clears throat)

This pain in my calves, it's always there now. Can't shake it off no matter what I do. And when I stand up or walk for too long, it gets even worse. (pauses) What was I saying? Ah yes, the swelling... my legs have started to swell, especially around the ankles... and them blood vessels... you know, varicose veins... they're gettin' bigger, more noticeable, if you know what I mean.

I think it started a few months ago... or was it last year? (chuckles) Shoot, I'm all confused now. But it's been gettin' worse, that's for sure. Can't even take my usual walk around the block without feelin' like I've got lead weights in my legs... (trails off) Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses?","I think I've been having these pains in my calves, yes sir... constant now... used to be just after a long walk or when I stood for too long, but now it's like it's always there. (pauses) You know what? My wife Edna had those pains too. No, wait, that was her hip. (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I saying?

Right, my legs. They've started to... (pauses again) swell up something fierce. Like water balloons, they look like. And these blood vessels, well, you can see 'em now. Always thought it was just age spots or somethin', but the doc said nope, those's just varicose veins. I think that's what he said... var-ic-o-what? (laughs)

Anyway, so when I walk for a bit too long, my legs get all achy and sore. And sometimes it feels like pins and needles in there too. My cousin Mabel used to have that, but she said it was just her sciatica acting up. Sci-a-ti... (stammers) Oh dear me, I'm getting old.

Now, let's see... my wife Edna always says I should sit more often, get off those legs of mine. But then she goes and buys me one of them exercise bikes to ride on while I watch TV. (laughs) Guess I need to work on that balance some more...

(Continues talking, but gradually trails off)

Anyway... as I was sayin', this calf pain... it's been gettin' worse, like I said. Can't just walk around without feelin' it no more. Don't know what to do about it..."
62,Varicose Veins,The veins in my legs are causing discomfort and difficulty sleeping at night. I have no idea why it is happening. I get cramps when I sprint.,"""Ah, Doc, you know my legs... they've been actin' up somethin' fierce. Discomfort, that's what I'd call it. Can't sleep at night no more, tossin' and turnin' like a wild animal. I swear, I was fine till... um... how many years ago? 20? No, 30? Anyway, I used to walk my grandkids to school every morning, but now I'm gettin' these cramps when I... you know, run or somethin'. Sprint's too strong a word, I think. What was I sayin'? Oh yeah, my legs! They're all swollen and... and... what's the word I want? Varicose, that's it! Veins in my legs, they're all... ah, you know how it is when your body just decides to play tricks on ya?""","I don't know what's goin' on with my legs... (pauses) You know, I was just talkin' to Mabel yesterday and she said her sister's cousin had something similar, but it was in her feet. Now, I'm not sure if that's right... (chuckles) Anyway...

The veins in my legs, they're all swollen, I think. Yeah, like big balloons stuck under the skin. And when I try to sleep at night, they hurt somethin' fierce. Can't get comfortable no matter what I do. Like, sometimes I'll be layin' there and suddenly my whole leg will just... (gestures with hands) You know?... ache.

And then there's these cramps... (pauses, searching for words) You see, when I used to run in high school – (pauses again) Oh boy, was that a long time ago! – we'd have to sprint across the field and sometimes my legs would get all cramped up. Like this one time, I remember... (laughs) We were playin' against Oakdale High, and I had to run so fast, but then my leg just locked up on me. Had to stop right in the middle of the game.

Now, it's not like that anymore. It's more... (hesitates) general discomfort, I suppose. My legs feel all tight and achy most of the time. Can't even explain it... (trails off)"
63,Varicose Veins,The swelling in my legs is causing me to have difficulty fitting into my shoes. I can't sprint or stand for long periods of time. I can see some swollen blood vessels.,"You know, doc... (pauses) Oh dear, I was just thinking about my sister Edna, she's always been on her feet, never stops moving... anyway... My legs, they're all swollen, you see. Can't fit into my shoes no more. It's like my feet are stuck in these things. (chuckles) I remember when I used to be able to run after the kids, play catch with them... (pauses again) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! Swelling. And I can see those big, blue veins on my legs. Like little rivers, they are. (hesitates) I don't know how long it's been like this, doc. Time just slips away from me these days...","Oh dearie me... I'm gettin' all puffy like a big ol' marshmallow down here (taps legs). Swellin', they call it? Yeah, my legs are swellin'. It's hard to get into these new shoes I bought last week. What was the occasion for that purchase again? Ah yes, my grandkid's birthday... no wait, was it a wedding? Shoot, anyway... The shoes don't fit like they used to. Now, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! My legs.

Now, let me tell ya about this... thing (taps knee). These big veins on the back of my leg, they're all... well, you see 'em too, right? Swollen blood vessels or somethin'. (pauses) Uh-oh, where's that picture I took with my grandkid? Oh, dear me...

You know, it's hard to stand for long periods like I used to at the market. (laughs) My husband always says, ""Why do you need so much time to buy one can of beans?"" (chuckles) Ah, those were good times... anyway... Sprintin'? Fuhgeddaboudit! Can barely walk faster than a snail these days.

I swear, I was at the doctor just last month and they said somethin' about... uh... edema? Is that it? Or is that them fancy shoes I got for my anniversary? (pauses) Anniversary? We were married in '52, if you can believe it! (chuckles)"
64,Varicose Veins,I have noticed cramps in my calves are becoming more frequent and intense. It is causing me a lot of discomforts. I am also overweight and my legs have started to swell.,"""Ah, doc... I've been having these cramps in my calves, and let me tell you, they're gettin' worse. More frequent, more intense...

More frequent, more intense. Can't even walk down the street without wanting to cry out in pain. Discomforts, that's what I call 'em. Can't even get a good night's sleep with those things goin' on. 

My doc's been tellin' me to exercise, but how can I? My legs, they're like lead weights now. Swollen up somethin' awful... and my feet, oh dear Lord, the pain in my feet! Like someone's stuck a knife in 'em and won't pull it out. 

Now, let me think for a sec... what was it we were talkin' about? Ah yes, cramps. So, I got these medicines for high blood pressure, and the doc said they'd help with water retention too. But now my legs are all puffy like balloons! Don't know what's goin' on. Guess I need to lose some weight... if that's possible at my age... 

(whispering) Excuse me, do you have a tissue? Got this tickly cough... Ah, anyway... cramps. They're gettin' so bad I'm afraid to walk outside 'cause I might trip and hurt myself somethin' awful... (chuckles nervously)

Geez, my mind's all over the place today! Did we talk about my arthritis? Or was that last week? (pauses) Cramps in my calves... more frequent, more intense. Discomforts, just can't shake 'em..."

So my legs. It's been going on for weeks, maybe months now. Don't know exactly when it started. Was it after that trip to the mountains? No, no, that was years ago...

Now, after a short little while, I'm up walkin' around again.

(pauses, looks away)

You know, I was talkin' to my neighbor, Edna... she said her sister-in-law had the same problem. (pauses) Wait, what was that sister-in-law's name? Oh yes, Mabel! Mabel had some sort of varicose veins, or maybe it was just her husband who did. (laughs)

(back to the topic at hand)

Anyway... as I were sayin', them veins on my legs. When I sit for too long, they get all swollen up and painful. It's like they're full of... full of... you know what? (taps foot) Oh dear, it's right on the tip of my tongue!

(pauses again)

Now, let me think... when did this start? Was it after that surgery I had? Or was it before? Shoot, I've been forgettin' things like crazy lately. My wife always says I'm gettin' older and slower... (chuckles) Slow down, she says.

(gets back on track)

It's spreadin' now. Started on just one leg, then it went to both. I think it was about two weeks ago? Maybe a bit more? I'm not sure. Anyway, it's getting pretty bad. I had to stop goin' for walks with the ladies from the church, and even just gettin' around the house is a chore. Run? Ha! Don't you know I haven't been runnin' in years?

Anyway, the rash on my legs is spreadin' and gettin' worse by the day. Now, you see, it's not just a little redness or nothin'. No sir, it's like... fire ants bit me all over! Can't even walk without feelin' like I'm on coals. (mumbles to self) Coals...

You know what they say about gettin' older? ""It'll catch up with you eventually."" What does that mean, anyway? Don't recall talkin' to my sister 'bout this... (stops suddenly)

Right! My legs. Now I'm tellin' ya, Doc, it's got me slowed down somethin' fierce. Can barely take a step without hollerin' at the pain. And run? Ha! Haven't been able to do that in years, anyway. What was the question again? (chuckles) Oh boy...

Oh dear, I remember now – my grandkids said they saw me trippin' on the porch steps last week... Thought maybe it was just old age... but this rash... I'm gettin' worried, Doc. Or is that Dr.? You know who you are, right? (laughs nervously)

Now, what were we talkin' 'bout again? Oh yes! The rash! It's like a thousand mosquito bites all at once! Don't even get me started on the itching... Can barely sleep for thinkin' about them itches..."

Ah yes, June. No, wait, I think it was July... anyway, as I was saying, these blood vessels are quite noticeable. I've been getting them more often lately, I suppose since I started taking those walking classes at the community center...","I don't know if I mentioned this before... my legs, they're been actin' up somethin' fierce lately.

I get these cramps now and then, especially in my calves. They're not too bad, but it's just... you know, it's like my body's sayin' ""stop right there."" (chuckles) I was talking to my sister the other day about my aching back, and she said something about her friend's husband had this... what was it? Oh yes, varicose veins. That's it! My blood vessels are all visible now, like little blue strings under my skin.

Now, where did I put those reading glasses? (pauses) Ah yes, the cramps. They usually come when I'm walkin' uphill or on uneven ground. And sometimes... (hesitates) Did I tell you about the time we went to the beach and my son built that sandcastle? (laughs softly) Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yes, my legs! It's all connected, isn't it? The cramps and these veins, they're like two old friends havin' a party under my skin. (chuckles) Sorry, sorry, I get carried away... but you see what I mean. It's just... I don't know if this is normal or not, doc... (trails off)"
68,Varicose Veins,The prominent blood vessels on my calves are causing self-consciousness and embarrassment. I believe the problem is because of my overweight.,"""Ah, doc... those veins on my legs, they're just so... noticeable, ya know? Makes me feel like I'm 20 years older than I am. Must be from all this extra weight, if you ask me. My sister-in-law's husband had them, too... no, wait, it was his mom... anyway, her name was Ethel, and she used to say... uh, what was the point of that? Oh right! The veins! Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's from being overweight. I mean, look at me, doc – I've got a bit of a spare tire goin' on here... (chuckles) Anyway, these veins, they're just... prominent, is what I'd say.

(smiling) She thought it would cover up those... you know, veins on my calves. (pauses again) But they're still there, and now that I'm getting on in years... well, it's just a bit embarrassing, if you know what I mean.

I think it might be because of my weight, Doctor. You see, when we were younger, I used to love gardening, and after all those hours kneeling, my legs would swell up like balloons! (laughs) My poor wife would have to rub them down with that cream... what was it called? Ah yes, Vaseline! She'd always say, ""You should lose some weight, dear."" And I said, ""I will, I will!"" But, well... (trails off)

Now, where's my tea? I could swear I left it right here on the table. Oh dear me, anyway... those veins on my legs. I've been noticing them more and more lately, especially after taking a hot bath or, you know, when I'm walking uphill in my neighborhood. It makes me feel self-conscious, Doctor. Self-conscious, like people are staring at me all the time. (pauses once more) Do you think it's just my imagination running wild?"
69,Varicose Veins,The skin around the veins on my legs is dry and flaky. It seems there is a major bruise and my legs have started to swell.,"""You see, doc... I mean, um, doctor... (coughs) excuse me, my skin around the veins on my legs, it's all dry and flaky now. Can't even recall when that started, might've been last week or was it two?

(chuckles) Oh dear, anyway, my legs are all swollen now too. Been eating more salt maybe? My daughter-in-law says we should watch our sodium intake... (hesitates) Wait, what's the name of this one medication I'm supposed to be taking for my blood pressure again? Oh yes, that's right! The... uh, (pauses again) Ah, never mind, it's not important.

You know, before I had those nice hand creams... (chuckles) What was the name of that cream again? Ah yes... Eucerin! That was it.

Now, where was I? Oh right, my legs. So there's this big ol' bruise on my left calf. Must've been from fallin' down on the stairs last week... or was it last month? (laughs) Time gets away from you, doesn't it? Anyway, it hurts when I put pressure on it.

And then there's all this swelling... I mean, not just in one leg, both of 'em. It looks like my poor ankles are stuck in them water balloons again! (chuckles) Water balloons! Ah yes... summer camp... I'm getting old...

My skin is dry and flaky, you see. And that bruise, it's just so big now. I think I must've hit something hard... or maybe not. My legs feel like they're gonna pop! Like when my sister's tomatoes would get too ripe in the garden. (giggles) Tomatoes...

I'm worried about this bruising and swelling... Do you take good notes? Can you write that down for me, dear? And what was it we were talkin' about again?"

Anyway, mine's on my legs, and it's spreadin', I'm pretty sure. (chuckles) I remember when my husband first got sick with that kidney thing... oh dear, what was his name? Ah yes, George! He had rashes all over him. (sighs)

Oh, right. The rash. It's been doin' this for a while now... I don't know, two weeks maybe? Three? Time just slips on you when you're gettin' older, doesn't it? (laughs) My mother used to say that... anyway, the doctor gave me some cream for it, but it hasn't really done much good. The rash just keeps gettin' worse... and it's so itchy!

Now where was I? Ah yes, the rash. It's been there for... (counts on fingers) ...four days now? Five? (shrugs) Time flies when you're havin' fun! (laughs nervously) Anyway, it's red and inflamed, like a big ol' pimple, but all over my legs! Can't even wear my favorite slacks no more. (sighs)

Now, I did try puttin' some... what's that stuff called? Ah yes, calamine lotion on it. But it didn't do much good, if you ask me. Just seemed to make it itchier...(pauses again) Did I tell you about my sister's cat? Such a long story... (trails off)

They're more noticeable than my husband's nose during a sinus flare-up! (laughs)

My sister used to make them all the time when we were kids... (trails off)

Lord have mercy, those were tough times... (chuckles) But what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the bruises.

Now, I'm pretty sure I took care of my legs like I always do – stretchin', movin' around... You know, it's funny, back when we had our garden out in the backyard, my wife would always say to me, ""Harry, you're gettin' too old for this."" (laughs) Oh boy, she was a firecracker, that one...

Oh, right. The bruises. They're just little purple spots... Not swollen or nothin'. I've been meanin' to ask someone about 'em, but with all the grandkids and the gardenin', you know how it is.

Protrude from the skin, that's what they do. Like little blue worms... No, not blue, I think it was purple once? (chuckles nervously) Don't mind me, getting old and silly... Always something with these veins... Swollen, prominent... What was that one word we were just talking about, doctor?..."

Had that done a while back... anyway... what was I sayin'? Oh yes! My legs! Been gettin' these cramps, and it feels like nothin' else, ya see? Like someone's squeezin' 'em from the inside out. 

Walkin', standin', don't matter how long – it just gets worse, ya know? And it's not just my legs neither... sometimes I get this numbness in my feet. Can't feel a thing! Now, was I sippin' tea that day or coffee when we last talked about this? Uh, doesn't matter now...

These pains, like cramps, they're so bad that even after I sit down for a bit, it takes forever to go away... Well, not forever, but you get the idea. It's like my legs just remember all the pain from before and decide to bring it back! You know what would be nice? A nice cup of tea on this lovely day. 

Anyway, as I was sayin', standin' or walkin', doesn't make a difference – after a while, it becomes... well, more like... uh, a burning feelin'? Not exactly sure if that's the word, but you know what I mean! Like someone poured fire down my legs. Now, where did I put those tea bags?"
77,Varicose Veins,The cramps in my calves have been making it difficult for me to walk and do my daily activities. They come on suddenly and last for several minutes.,"Doctor... (pauses) You know, I was out in my garden yesterday, and I saw that new robin, wasn't it? I think its name is... uh... (chuckles) anyway... 

These cramps, they've been acting up somethin'. In my calves, you see. Makes it hard to walk around the house, let alone get any work done. (pauses) My daughter was over for dinner last night, and she said I'd be fine, just take some rest... but I know I'm not fine. 

They come on sudden-like, without warning. Then they linger on for a bit. Several minutes, I think? Or is that hours? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' old...

It started... hmm... was it after that big storm we had last month? Or was it the one before? Doesn't matter now... (sighs) Anyway, these cramps. They're a nuisance, that's what they are.","(sigh) Oh dearie me... (pauses) Ah yes, my calves... they've been acting up somethin' fierce lately. Can't walk down the street without gettin' these cramps in 'em. It's like a vise grip, I swear. (chuckles to self) You know, when I was younger, we used to call it ""muscle fatigue""... or so my friend Mabel said... (trails off)

What was I sayin'? Ah yes! These cramps. They come on sudden-like, out of nowhere. No warning signs, nothin'. Just a sharp pain in the calf, and I'm hoppin' around like a rabbit on one foot. (pauses) Now, where did I put that tea kettle? Haven't used it all day... (mutters to self)

It's been goin' on for weeks now... or was it months? Can't rightly remember no more. Time gets away from you when you're my age. (giggles) You know, we used to have a saying: ""Age is just a number."" But I think that's just a bunch of hooey. My body's startin' to believe it, though... (sigh)

Anyway, these cramps... they last for several minutes, at least. Long enough to make me want to sit down and put my feet up. (pauses) Now, what was the question? Ah yes! The cramps. I've tried... um... ice packs? No, that's not it. Heat? Maybe heat would help... or is it cold? Always gettin' those two mixed up..."
78,Varicose Veins,The swelling in my legs has gotten worse over the past few weeks and is causing me difficulty fitting into my shoes. It is also causing discomfort when I sit for long periods of time.,"""You know, doctor... (pause) Oh boy, I swear that water bill just keeps getting higher and higher! (chuckles) Anyway... my legs, they've been swelling like crazy for weeks now. I don't know, maybe it's been two months? Time sure flies when you get older, doesn't it? (laughs)

Anyway, it's really started to be a problem. Can't fit into my good walking shoes no more, and sitting down for too long makes me feel... well, it's hard to describe. It's like my legs are just, ugh... tired, I guess. Or achy. You know what I mean? And at night, when I'm getting ready for bed, it feels a bit... heavy. Yeah, that's the word. Heavy.""","Let me tell you, Doc... (pauses) Excuse me for a minute, I think I left the stove on at home... no, wait, that's not right... (chuckles)

Anyway, my legs... they're just getting so swollen, it's like balloons or somethin'. (pauses again) Now, where was I? Ah yes, my legs. It started a few weeks ago, and I thought, ""Oh, it'll go away,"" but nope! It keeps gettin' worse. My shoes don't fit, not even the stretchy ones... I had to wear them last week with some of those big rubber bands around 'em, and they were still too tight.

And sittin' down for a long time? Forget about it! It's like someone's pinchin' me from the inside out. (pauses once more) Now, what was I sayin'? Oh yes... I remember when I used to take them long walks with my wife... we'd walk around the block three times without breakin'. But nowadays, even a short drive to the park would be too much for these old legs... (trails off)

Discomfort, that's the word. Discomfort in the legs. That's all I know... not like this other thing that happens sometimes when I get up from sleepin', and my knees feel funny for no reason at all. (starts to ramble) Reminds me of the time... or was it before? Anyway, you'll figure out what's goin' on with these legs, Doc. Just make sure to look into my ears while you're at it; they've been pluggin' up a bit lately too..."

They are swollen and protrude from my skin, making them visible through my clothing.","""Doc, you know, I've been having these... veins on my legs, yeah? They're really noticeable now. My granddaughter said they look like big worms, but that's not nice, is it? (chuckles) Anyway, they're swollen and, oh dear, they stick out from under the skin something awful. Can barely wear my good slacks no more 'cause of this... discomfort, yes, that's what I call it. Discomfort. Don't know if it's just the heat or... or what we had for dinner last night. Ah, was it spaghetti? Anyway, they're causing me a lot of trouble now.""","I don't know if I mentioned this before... (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, my legs! They're just so... swollen. You see them right away, even through my clothes. (chuckles) My husband says it's like I'm wearing striped socks or something. (laughs)

Veins on my legs, they're very prominent now. I mean, they were always there, but lately... (pauses again) What was I doing today? Oh dear, I had to make some lunch for the ladies at the church. Delicious sandwiches, you know. Anyway, back to my legs...

It's like they're trying to pop out of my skin or something! (laughs nervously) I've been wearing these... (pauses, searching for words) compression socks, yes, that's it. My daughter got them for me, said it would help with the circulation. But honestly, they just make me feel all tight and stuffy.

Discomforts, you see. That's what it is. It's like my legs are protesting or something! (chuckles) I know it sounds silly, but trust me, it's not pleasant. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with... (pauses, trying to recall) what was it again? Ah yes! A cramp! In my leg, and it feels like someone's just squeezing it. Oh dear...

Time sure flies when you're having fun... or is that the other way around? (laughs) Sorry, I'm getting off track. My legs, yes... well, they've been this way for weeks now. And the swelling, it comes and goes, but it's like my legs are just trying to draw attention to themselves! (giggles nervously)

Now, where did I put that recipe book? Ah, dearie me..."
80,Varicose Veins,"The skin on my calves is itchy and inflamed, causing a lot of discomfort and difficulty sleeping at night. The blood vessels have started to protrude out, which is concerning.","Oh dear, doctor... my calves, you see... they're been actin' up somethin' fierce. Itchy and inflamed, like someone's got a red-hot brandin' iron on 'em. Can't even sleep at night no more, thinkin' about it's all day long. My sister-in-law Edna had the same thing, or was it my cousin? Ah yes, my cousin... anyway... (chuckles) 

Now where was I? Oh right, my calves! They're like two big red welts, and them blood vessels... (taps leg) ...they just pop out now. It's gettin' so they show up like little blue strings on my skin. Scary business, if you ask me. Don't know what to make of it. My wife says I should try... uh... that new cream she read about in the newspaper. No, no, not that one... (laughs) Oh dear, gettin' all mixed up now!","I'm so glad I came in today, Doctor... been meanin' to for weeks now. Anyway, my skin, yes, my calves, they're itchy, inflamed... (pauses) You know, I was out gardenin' last weekend, and I must've gotten some bug bite or somethin', 'cause my legs started feelin' all prickly after that. Must be the pollen or them new azaleas... (trails off)

Oh, sorry, where was I? Ah yes, my calves! It's this... this itchiness, and it's been goin' on for a bit now. Keeps me up at night, too. Can't sleep with these skin issues... always fidgetin', tryin' to scratch 'em, but then they just get worse, you know? (pauses again) Did I mention my sister's cat had fleas once? Such a nuisance! My niece loved playin' with it, though...

Now, where was I? Oh yes, the blood vessels. They're... they're bulgin' out now, too. Protrudin', I think that's the word... (pauses once more) You know, back in the war... no, not the war, it was the Depression... my cousin had varicose veins somethin' awful! Must've been from walkin' all them miles to the factory...

Anyway, Doctor, like I said, these blood vessels on my calves are concernin'. They're just so... prominent now. Do you think that's related to the itchiness? (pauses once more) I swear, sometimes I forget what day it is, let alone what's happenin' with me skin! (laughs nervously)"
81,Varicose Veins,The pain in my calves is constant and becomes worse when I stand or walk for long periods of time. I am getting constant cramps and can't run for longer periods of time.,"Oh dearie me... the pain in my calves, you know, it's been this way for ages now. Constant, it is. Gets worse when I stand up straight or walk too long, if you can call that too long. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I used to walk to school, uphill both ways! That was a good three miles each way... (pauses) Oh yes, my calves. They get these cramps, constant like. And running? Forget about it, dear doctor. Can't even go for a stroll without... what's the word... wincing. It's been this way since... hmm, I think it was last year or was it two years ago? (laughs) My mind's not as sharp as it used to be! Anyway, pain in calves, constant cramps, can't run far no more.","Oh dear doctor... I'm gettin' this pain in my calves now, for as long as I can remember... or was it just lately? Anyway, it's constant, like a... uh, a naggin' toothache that won't go away. (pauses) You know what would be nice right about now? A cup of tea... with sugar, of course.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It gets worse when I stand up straight for too long. Can't even take a walk without feelin' it. My son-in-law, he's got them new shoes, I think they're from that fancy store downtown... anyway, he says they're good for your feet. (chuckles) Maybe I'll have to get myself some of those.

But this pain, it's like my muscles are all cramped up and won't relax. I can feel 'em tightnin' when I try to walk far. Can't run no more either... not even a little bit. (sighs) Used to love runnin' around the block with the kids, but now... well, it's just too much.

You know what they say about old age: we're supposed to be gettin' slower and stiffer. But I always thought I was an exception! (laughs) Still got my garden, still do some cookin', but this pain... oh dear me... it's like tryin' to walk on rocks in the river.

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the cramps. Constant cramps, like a... uh... like when you forget where you put your keys? (laughs) Never mind, never mind. Just get this pain sorted out for me, would ya?"
82,Varicose Veins,"The veins in my legs are causing discomfort and difficulty sleeping at night. They are swollen and protruding from my skin, making them noticeable and painful.","Doc... (pauses) Oh boy, I'm glad I finally got an appointment. You know, my sister's brother-in-law had a similar problem with his veins, but it was in his feet, not legs. Anyway...(clears throat) The thing is, these... (taps leg) ...these veins in my legs, they're causing me quite a bit of discomfort. And the swelling, oh dear, it's making them stick out like sausages. Can't even sleep at night without feeling this... (hesitates) This pain in 'em.

You see, I've been having trouble with my circulation for years now... or was it just last week? (chuckles nervously) Oh well, details. It's been a while, anyway. Like that one time...(pauses, lost in thought) Ah yes! When we went to Florida on vacation... Never mind that. My point is, the discomfort and swelling are quite noticeable, even when I'm sitting still.","(sigh) Oh dear... my legs, you see... (pauses) I was at the early bird special at Denny's yesterday, and they had these new pancakes... fluffy ones, with strawberries on top... (chuckles) my friend Edna loves those... anyway...

My legs. Yes, it's this vein business again... or is it an artery? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those mixed up! Anyway... I was saying... my veins are all... swollen and whatnot. You can see 'em stickin' out like little balloons under the skin. Gives me the most dreadful feeling... (pauses, collecting thoughts)

Painful is the word. Yes, that's it. It hurts when I walk around the house or even just sit for a bit. Can't get comfortable, no sirree. And at night, oh boy... it's like my legs are screaming at me to get up and do something about 'em! (chuckles) Guess I should've gotten one of those exercise balls they have nowadays...

I used to be able to walk for miles without a problem, but now... (trails off) Now my knees ache too. Ah yes, I remember that time when... (distracted) no, wait, what was the question again? (laughs)

Oh dear, it's just so... inconvenient! Can't sleep, can't sit still... feels like I'm stuck in this... (pauses, searching for words) this torture chair all day long."

Can't even get into my favorite shoes no more. It's like, I remember when I was younger, I used to wear those tight dress shoes and think I was the cat's pajamas... (chuckles) Anyway... so it's the swelling. And then there's this other thing... sit down for too long, and it's like my legs are on fire! Can't take it no more. Now, what year is this again? 2023? No, wait, I think it was last year... uh... Don't mind me, just gettin' old in the head... anyway, swelling. That's the trouble.""","I don't know if you can understand me, I'm gettin' a little... (pauses) Oh boy, I was thinkin' about my grandson's birthday party last week. He's such a smart kid, got a girlfriend now too... (chuckles) Anyway...

The thing is, doc, or whomever it is I'm talkin' to... (laughs nervously) My legs, they're... swollen, that's the word. Can't quite fit into my shoes like I used to, you know? And when I sit down for a long time, oh boy, it hurts. (pauses, lost in thought)

Now, let me think on this... (taps fingers on armrest) Wasn't there something about salt? My sister said somethin' about eatin' too much salt causes swelling or some such thing. I'm not sure if that's right, but... (trails off)

Oh dear, my mind is gettin' all jumbled up like my keys in the drawer. Where did I put those things? Ah yes...

The swelling, it's been gettin' worse lately. Can't even fit into these fancy shoes my wife bought me for our anniversary. (smiling) She says I'm gettin' a little too comfortable, but... (chuckles)

Now, let me start again from the top... My legs are swollen. And when I sit down... (pauses, searching for the right words) It's like there's no air in my bones or somethin'. That sounds silly, I know.

I've been having these cramps in my calves for ages now... and they're gettin' worse, if you can believe that. Can't even walk down the street without hollerin' out in pain.

Oh dearie me... anyway... these cramps are gettin' so bad, I'm startin' to feel like a hunchback. And my daily activities, oh boy... forget about 'em. Can't even take care of myself no more.

( pause ) You know, that reminds me... I got a new neighbor next door. Name's... uh... Ed? No, wait, it was Earl... or is it Eddie? (chuckles) Oh well, doesn't matter. Anyway, they're nice folks. We had some nice apple pie last week... (trails off)

(suddenly serious again) But like I said, doc... these cramps are gettin' worse. And it's hard to do things I love anymore, 'cause of the pain...

The cramps, they're getting worse. More frequent and intense, you see. It's like a big ol' knot in there, all twisted up. Can't even walk around the block no more without it grabbin' onto me. (pauses to collect thoughts) And I was thinkin', it might be related to these new shoes I got. Too much support or somethin'. I remember my grandmother used to get cramps in her legs, too...

I'm pretty sure I took those calcium supplements, did they help? I mean, I think so... (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old, can't keep track of nothin'! Anyway... where was I?

It's gettin' in the way of my routine, you see. And I just had a doctor's appointment for my blood pressure, but they didn't mention anythin' about this. Did I forget somethin'? Now it's like... (pauses) My mind's goin', oh dear! (laughs awkwardly)

I hope that makes sense, doc? Or maybe it was the arthritis meds, causing these cramps... (hesitates) Oh, I don't know anymore! Can someone just tell me what's happenin' with my body?! (laughs again, this time a bit more frantically)"

You know, Edna always says I'm gettin' too comfortable, but what's a gal to do?... Ah yes! The veins. They swell up and bulge out of my skin, makin' 'em all red and achy.

And the worst part is, they stick out, if you know what I mean. Like little blue snakes (chuckles) everywhere! It's hard to explain...

Anyway, it started after my trip to Florida with Edna. We took a long car ride, hours on the road... Maybe that's why? Or was it that time I wore those new stockings for a party? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, what was I saying?

Now, where did I put that thingamajig... (rummages through purse) Ah, yes! My walking stick. It reminds me of my sister's arthritis... poor dear. She could hardly walk anymore. But anyway...

(pauses) Excuse me, did I turn off the stove? No, no, that was yesterday. Anyway, the rash on my legs... (hesitates) It started a few weeks ago, I think.

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the rash! So, it's red and inflamed, just like my Aunt Edna's face used to get when she'd eat too much chili. (chuckles) And it's so itchy! I swear, I've been scratching for hours every night... (pauses again) You know, I had a cat named Whiskers once, and he loved to scratch on the furniture... (laughs)

Anyway, this rash is spreading fast. It started on my calves, but now it's up to my knees. And the itching gets worse at night, makes it hard to sleep. I've been trying to use that calamine lotion you gave me last time, but it only helps for a little while... (trails off) Did I mention my husband has been having trouble with his knee too? Maybe we should get him to see your colleague, Dr... uh... what's-his-name.

I'm sorry, what was the question again? Oh right, the rash! Just be sure to check for any other symptoms. You know, when I had that gallbladder surgery years ago, they told me it would reduce my risk of certain conditions... (fades off)"

I think I got sunburned something awful. (chuckles) Ah, yes... my legs.

Anyway, when I try to exercise, which is hard enough at my age, they just feel so... heavy. And swollen. (pauses) I had a cousin who had varicose veins. Poor soul was always complaining about them. Must've been the same thing I have. (stammers) Unless it's something else entirely... (trails off)

And don't even get me started on my veins. They're like balloons, just sticking out all over the place. And they hurt! (exasperated sigh) Sometimes I feel like I'm walking around with two sticks instead of legs. Fatigue? Ha! That's a nice word for it. I'm exhausted. Can't even walk to the mailbox without needing to sit down.

My veins. They're just so swollen and stickin' out now. It's like they're tryin' to make a break for it or somethin'. I was at the grocery store the other day, and I saw this young fella with them veins on his legs too. But he didn't seem bothered by 'em.

So, yes. My legs. The skin around my veins is all dry and flaky now. It itches something awful, especially at night when I'm lying in bed. I have to scratch and scratch until my poor hands are red and sore too. And then there's these cramps... oh dear me, the cramps! They come on out of nowhere, like a sneeze or something. Can't walk from the couch to the kitchen without one hitting me.

Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, dry skin. Now my arms are getting it too. Or is that just age spots? No, no, it's not age spots... (pauses) My husband used to take care of those for me, all the time he'd be scraping off these big scaly patches with this special cream... I wonder what ever happened to that cream...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, cramps. They're so painful! And they're coming more often too, just like clockwork. It's quite the nuisance, if you ask me. Now, let me think for a moment... wasn't there something else? (pauses) Umm... Ah yes, my cousin Edna had those same leg cramps when she was younger. She said it was from walking uphill too much. But I'm not doing any more hill-walking than usual, that's just crazy talk...

Oh dear me, anyway. Just wanted to mention this dry skin and the cramps... (trails off)"

You know, the ones with all them laces? Anyway, now I got another one. It hurts somethin' fierce. Like a cramp, you know what I mean? Can't even walk without wincin'. And now I'm gettin' these visible veins on my calf. Must be from standin' up too fast or... or sittin' down wrong. Always do that, don't I?

Oh boy, I remember when my sister got varicose veins and she said it was the end of the world. But she just ended up gettin' those stockings with the support. You know, the ones they wear for athletes? Anyway... back to this rash... It's like a burnin' sensation, not just on the surface but deep down in my bones. I swear I've been sweatin' more since it started. Must be from the heat or... or somethin'.

I'm pretty sure I saw somethin' about it on TV. Was it that Dr. Oz? He said something about circulatory problems and... and what's-the-word... varicosities! That's it! I'm tellin' ya, Doc, this is related to my circulation somehow. Must be from all the time I spent on my feet when I was workin'."

She got a new fountain, and it's quite a sight... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the question again? Ah yes, the veins. They're, uh, bulging out like balloons now. You can see 'em through my skin, just like that picture I saw in the doctor's office last year about varicose veins. It hurt when I moved yesterday... or was it today? (chuckles) Oh, Lord have mercy, time gets away from me... anyway, it hurts when I move my legs, especially if I'm walking up them stairs to the kitchen.","Doc... or is it nurse? Anyway, you know my legs, always been a bit of trouble for me, especially after that knee surgery I had. But now, these veins on my legs, they're like, oh boy, really showing themselves. You can see 'em right through the skin, it's quite... um... (pauses) what was I saying? Oh yeah! The veins. They're all swollen and blueish, like... like a big bruise.

You know, it hurts when I move around, especially my left leg. (chuckles) I think it might be because of that time I slipped on the ice last winter. No, wait, was it this spring? Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's not just because of that... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The veins. They're more visible than normal, and I can feel them throbbing sometimes when I walk or stand for too long. It's like my legs are trying to tell me something, but what, I'm not quite sure. (laughs) Maybe they just want some... uh... compression socks or something.

You know, I was at the store yesterday, and I saw one of those things that looks like a big elastic bandage. You wear it on your leg, and it's supposed to help with circulation. I think I might have even bought one once... (pauses, confused) No, no, that was for my granddaughter, wasn't it? Anyway...

It hurts, doc... or is it nurse... when I move around. Like I said, especially my left leg. And these veins, they're just getting worse and worse. What do you think it could be? (trails off, lost in thought)"

Anyway, he said something about exercise, but I'm tired just thinkin' 'bout gettin' up to do a walk in the park. (chuckles) That reminds me, we went to the park last week and saw those nice ducks swimmin'... anyway... after a bit of work, I'm plumb tuckered out.

(gets sidetracked) Did you know my cousin could walk 10 miles a day? Good Lord, what was his name again? Oh right, Bob. Anyway...

Obesity, that's what it is. That's the root of all these problems. (pauses) You know, I think I saw that on TV... one of those documentaries about... about (struggles to remember) ...heart disease! That's it. They said if you're overweight, you get cramps and all sorts of other things. Makes sense, don't it? (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, exhaustion. After a while, after working in the garden or doin' chores, I'm plumb tuckered out. Can barely make it to the porch without needin' a rest. (pauses again) You know what they say... ""If at first you don't succeed, try tryin' again""... Something like that. Or was it my grandma who said that? (laughs)

Anyway, I think it's high time for one of those new-fangled treatments... you know, the ones with the pills or shots. What's it called... (pauses once more) Ah yes! Lipitor! No, no... not that one. The other one. You know, where they give you a special injection? (stares off into space)

I'm worried sick about 'em, Doctor. What if it's somethin' serious? My sister-in-law had varicose veins, and she had to get surgery... or was it my cousin?

It hurts somethin' awful when I stand up after sittin' for a while. Like my legs are sayin', ""Hey, we're not gettin' no younger!"" (laughs) Oh dear, I remember when I was younger... I used to walk for miles without breakin' a sweat. What's the world comin' to? These days... (pauses)

These veins, they're big and bulgy and just... (hesitates) I don't know how to describe it. My sister had some sort of cream for that, but I think she was talkin' about her face...

(starts to ramble) Oh, and have I told you about the time I went to the lake with my family? We had a picnic, and... (stops suddenly)

It is unusual, ain't it? I mean, most people don't have their veins just... poppin' out like this. (chuckles nervously) Do you think it's something I should be worried about, doctor... (pauses again) Wait, where did I put my teeth? Oh dear..."

This swelling business has been going on for... two days now? Maybe three? Hard to keep track. My legs are quite uncomfortable, if I'm being honest.

Too much TV-watching when I was younger, that's for sure. (laughs again)

There's this little bruise on my calf, but I'm not sure if that's the problem or just an old injury. You see, I used to play baseball when I was a young fella... (trails off)

I had a few good years playing shortstop... then I got hit by a pitch and... (sighs) Never mind. Where was I? Ah yes, the bruise!

As I was saying, the itching is intense, Doctor... or should I say, ""the doc""... *chuckles*. It keeps me up at night, makes me scratch and scratch till my skin gets all sore.

I've been feeling just terrible lately, Doctor. (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes, now I remember. My appetite, it seems, has left me. Can't seem to eat a thing. Not even a bowl of soup, no sir. (chuckles) Reminds me of when my granddaughter visited last year and we had that big ol' roast chicken... anyway... (clears throat)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my appetite. It's just gone, like a whispered secret in the wind. Can't even think about food without feeling queasy. And that's got me worried sick, if you don't mind me saying so. Health's been on my mind day and night... or is it night and day? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up.

Now, what was the name of that medication I took for high blood pressure? You know, the one with all the side effects? (pauses) Shoot, can't recall now. Never mind, not important right this minute. Anyway... (hesitates) My worry's about my health, and how it keeps slipping away from me like sand between fingers. Time I did something about that, don't you think?

And would you believe I found a recipe for fried chicken in my old cookbook? Thought of making it today, but... no, can't even muster up the strength to boil water. (sighs) Guess that's just an example of how poorly I'm eating. Doctor says I need more fruits and veggies, but what's the point if you can't enjoy a good meal like your grandma used to make?"
154,Chicken pox,There are small red spots all over my body that I can't explain. It's worrying me. I feel extremely tired and experience a mild fever every night.,"""Oh dear, doc... I mean, um, I think I've had these little red spots for... was it last week? No, wait, maybe a month ago? Oh, it doesn't matter. They just pop up all over me, everywhere! And they itch something awful, but when I scratch 'em, nothin' comes out. It's like those welts my cousin had after that bee sting incident... you know, the one with the picnic at the lake?

""Anyway, I'm gettin' so tired, doc. My legs feel heavy, and I just wanna sit down all the time. And this fever every night... (sigh) it's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I don't know what. It's got me worried sick. I swear, I must've eaten somethin' bad... or maybe it was that flu goin' 'round the neighborhood last year?""","I'm gettin' all these... uh... little red spots, yeah, all over my body. Can't figure out what they are, doc said maybe some kinda rash? But I don't know, I've never seen nothin' like 'em before. They're small, like pinpricks, but they hurt a bit when I touch 'em. Worryin' me somethin' fierce.

And then there's this... (pauses) Oh, I remember my cousin had some spots like that once! No, wait, it was her sister. Anyway, she got over it fine, so maybe I'll be okay too? (trails off)

But what really gets me is the tiredness. Lord have mercy, I'm exhausted all the time. Can't keep up with my gardenin' no more. Used to love tendin' to my flowers and vegetables... (starts humming) Oh, I remember when my husband used to help me...

Where was I? Ah yes, fever. Every night, it's like a little tickle in my throat. Mild, doc says, but it keeps me up for hours. Can't sleep with this... this... (taps forehead) what do you call it? Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue...

I've been feelin' kinda lightheaded too, like I might just pass out if I get up too quick. My mind's all muddled, can't think straight no more... (pauses, looking around) Now where did I put my slippers?"
155,Chicken pox,"My lymph nodes are swollen, causing discomfort in my neck and armpits. I don't know what's causing it.","""My lymph nodes, dear... they're all swollen, I'm sure of it. Been like that for weeks now, maybe months? I don't know, time flies when you're having fun, doesn't it? My son's birthday was just last weekend, and he's getting so big... (pauses) anyway, my neck, armpits... they ache something awful. Especially in the mornings, you'd think it would clear up by then, but nope. I've been taking those supplements, vitamin C and B, and... oh, what was I saying? Oh yes! The pain, it's like a dull ache, not sharp at all. Can't say if it's worse or better than usual, to be honest... (pauses again) what day is it today?""","I'm so sorry doc... I think I might've mentioned this before? No, no, wait, what was I sayin'? Oh dear, my memory's been actin' up lately... (chuckles) Ah, yes! My lymph nodes! They're all swollen and achy, I suppose you'd call it. Neck, armpits, you know how it is... like a big ol' knot in there. (pauses) Now, where was I? Oh, right! The doctor I saw last week said somethin' about my blood work... but I don't rightly recall what he said. (trails off)

Anyway... so the swelling's been botherin' me for a while now. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I think it was around that time I had that nasty cold? You know, the one with the fever and the sniffles? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was then. (pauses again) Unless... unless it's related to this other thing... you know, when I went to the store and they gave me a can of soup that had a funny label on it? No, no, never mind... that's not important.

Oh dear, where am I goin' with this? Ah yes! My neck. It hurts to move my head or somethin', like there's a big ol' boulder in the way. And don't even get me started on the armpits! (laughs) Oh boy... they feel all puffy and sore, like I stuck 'em in a vice. (pauses once more) Wait, what was I sayin'? Something about my lymph nodes? Right-o! They're all swollen, that's what it is... (trails off)"
156,Chicken pox,"I'm feeling really sick and uncomfortable like something is wrong inside. I don't know what it could be. I noticed small red spots on my arms, which itches if I touch them.",".. doc was at my house just yesterday, and he said I should come see you. Um... anyway... I'm feelin' pretty crummy. Got this thing inside me, like a knot or somethin', that don't feel right. Can't quite put my finger on it. You know, Mabel's niece has the same problem, but she thinks it's her sinuses. Sinuses, not inside her body, mind you... (chuckles) I always get those mixed up.

Now, where was I? Ah yes! These little red spots on my arms. They itch somethin' fierce if I touch 'em. Not too big, but they're spread out all over. Can't recall when I first saw 'em... was it Tuesday or Wednesday? Don't rightly matter, I s'pose. What's important is gettin' to the bottom of this, doc's sayin' we'll figure somethin' out.","I'm not feelin' too good, doc... don't know what's goin' on inside me, if you know what I mean. Feel all funny and uncomfortable, like somethin' is... uh... (pauses) ...stirrin' around in there, ya know? Don't know how to describe it. Reminds me of that time I had the flu back in '52... no, wait, was it '55? Had a cousin over for dinner and he spilled coffee all over my favorite rug... anyway...

Red spots on my arms, like little freckles or somethin'. Itches when I touch 'em. Don't know why it's doin' that. Maybe it's them new allergies... took some of those pills you prescribed last week? Or was that the other stuff for... (trails off) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the spots! They're all over my arms, like a rash or somethin'. Don't know if it's important but I also had this funny sensation in my back yesterday... felt like someone was tappin' on me with a broom handle. (chuckles) Sounds silly now...

Itches when I touch 'em... not too sore, though. Just feels weird. Maybe it's from cookin' that lasagna last night? Overdid it on the cheese... or was it the garlic bread? Can't remember what I did with that recipe book... anyway, red spots and itchin', don't know if it means anything. Guess we'll just have to figure it out together, won't we, doc? (pauses again)"
157,Chicken pox,The itching is making it hard for me to sleep at night. I can't get any rest. I have also lost my appetite and feel lethargic.,"The itching is makin' it hard for me to sleep at night... been goin' on for... hmm, I think it's been three days now? Or was it last week? Oh dear, time sure flies when you're old! Anyway, can't get no rest with this itchiness all over. My skin's all scratchy and red, like when I used to go out in the sun too long back in '52... Lord have mercy, that was a burn on my nose!

And then there's this tiredness, lethargic they call it, don't know what that means exactly... but I'm just so exhausted. Can't even get excited about my grandkids' visits no more! Lost my appetite too... haven't eaten a decent meal in days...","I'm havin' trouble sleepin', Doctor... can't get a wink in for nothin'. This itch, Lord have mercy... it's like my skin is on fire! *pauses* Oh, that reminds me, I was talkin' to Edna from the church, and she said her sister had something similar, but I think it might've been eczema... or was it arthritis? Hmm... *sigh*

Anyway, this itch... it's so bad I wake up in the middle of the night, sweatin' like a pig. Can't get comfortable. And then there's the food – I just can't stomach nothin'. My appetite's gone, just like that. *taps fingers on armrest* I remember when my grandmother used to say... uh, what was it? Oh yes! ""Eat an apple a day keeps the doctor away."" *chuckles*

Wait, where was I? Ah yes, sleepin'... can't get no rest. Felt like I've been run over by a truck, and I'm just too... lethargic. That's the word, isn't it? Lethargic... *yawns* Oh boy, excuse me, Doctor. Now what was it you said about that other thing? Oh yes, my high blood pressure. Been takin' those pills every morning, like clockwork..."

I can hardly sleep at night because of the itching,","I'm worried about this rash on my skin... (pauses) You know, I had one of those itching powders when I was younger for the mosquito bites and it worked like a charm... anyway, where was I? Oh yes, the rash. It's spreading rapidly and causing a lot of discomforts. I can hardly sleep at night because of the itching, and my sister-in-law, is that Edna or Ethel, anyway... she had something similar last year, but I think it was just eczema... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting old... what was the question? Ah yes, the rash. It's on my arms and legs now, and it's driving me crazy!","I don't know if I should be worried about this rash... (pauses) You see, my granddaughter had a similar one last summer... or was it her cousin? Anyway, it looked just like that – red and scaly. My goodness, I remember now, we took her to the doctor and got some cream for it. (stammers) What was it called again? Ah yes, hydrocortisone! We applied that twice a day... or was it three times? (chuckles)

Oh dear, where was I going with this? Oh yes, my rash! It's been getting worse over the past week or so. I can hardly sleep at night because of the itching. (pauses) You know, I used to be able to take a nice long walk in the morning... before all these creaky joints got me down. (sighs) But now, even just rolling out of bed feels like I'm climbing Mount Everest! (laughs)

Now, this rash... it's spreading rapidly, isn't it? (looks around) Did I turn off the stove? Ah yes, my stove. My wife always said I was forgetful... (trails off) Anyway, as I was saying... the rash is quite uncomfortable. It's like someone's scratching a cat's skin or something. (laughs nervously)

( mutters to herself ) What was that doctor say about sun exposure? Ah yes, too much sun can cause all sorts of problems. Did I put on sunscreen today? Hmm... might have left it in the car..."
159,Chicken pox,I have no energy and have lost my appetite. I'm feeling really sick and don't know what's wrong.,"You know, Doc... I just can't get outta bed no more. No energy at all.

Can't even think about food. (hesitates) When was it, uh... last week? Yeah, last week... I tried to cook myself some eggs, but just couldn't finish 'em. Don't know what's goin' on with me. Feel like I've got the flu or somethin', but no fever... at least, I don't think so... (trails off)","I'm tellin' ya, I just can't seem to get goin' in the mornin'. No energy at all. I mean, I used to be able to... uh... do this and that... what was it? Oh yes, gardenin'! I loved gardinin'! My roses were always so... so... (pauses) Wait, where's my tea? I swear I left it right here...

Anyway, as I was sayin', no energy. And don't even get me started on my appetite. Used to love cookin' up a storm in the kitchen, but now... (sighs) Nothin' tastes good to me. I had soup for lunch yesterday and it just sat there, untouched. I mean, what's goin' on? I'm feelin' really... (pauses, searching for the right word) sick. Yes, that's it. Sick.

Now, let me think... when did this start? Was it after I fell down them steps? No, no, that was months ago... or was it last year? (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all jumbled! Anyway, as I was sayin', I'm feelin' really sick and I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe it's just a cold? No, no, it's more than that... (trails off)

Oh, look! There's a squirrel outside the window! (laughs) Oh my stars, those creatures are always gettin' into trouble! (pauses again) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, feelin' sick. Just really tired all the time... and nothin' seems to be doin' any good..."

(pauses again) Anyway, it started on my back, but now it's all over. Even on my face, a bit. (mumbles to self) When did I last take those pills...?

Wait, what was the question? Oh, the rash! Yes, like I said, it's red and inflamed... and that itching... can't even put my hands together without scratching.

Wait, did I tell you about the time... (pauses, starts to get distracted) Oh boy! We had the best garden in the neighborhood back then. Tomatoes so big and juicy... (stares off into space for a moment)

Now where was I? Ah yes, the itching! It's like someone poured gasoline on my skin or somethin'! Can't even sleep at night without reachin' over to scratch... My poor husband says I'm gonna wear down all these new sheets we got just last week.

You know, like when I used to go swimming in the lake as a kid? My husband, dear Ed... or is it Eddie? Anyway, he'd always say ""Don't get too much sun, Mabel."" Now I'm thinkin', maybe that's what this is? Red spots, fever... you see, my neighbor Mrs. Jenkins had something similar last year... or was it the year before?

Red spots, you see... all over my arms and legs. I've tried applying some aloe vera cream, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. And some of them are swollen! Swollen, I tell you! Like little blisters. (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe for my famous chicken soup? I had it right here... (rummages through pocket)

High fever, red spots, and swelling. That's what the young doctor said last time, anyway. Don't know if it's related to my arthritis or... or something else entirely. (stares off into space) Did I turn off the stove? I could've sworn I turned off the stove...

Red spots, like tiny little freckles. Some of them itch; others don't. It's all quite confusing, if you ask me. I've been using calamine lotion, but it only seems to make them worse... or is that better? (shrugs) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up...

You know, when I was a young woman, we didn't have all these new-fangled medications and whatnot. We just used good old-fashioned remedies like... like... oh yes! Epsom salts! My grandmother swore by Epsom salts for the skin. (trails off)"

(chuckles) No, no, of course not... anyway...

Now, this rash, it's been getting worse over the past few days, and my temperature... (pauses to think) Oh dear, what was the temperature again? Ah yes! 102, I think. My granddaughter said something about that being a fever, but I don't rightly know. You'd know, Doctor... (trails off)

Discomforts, you see... (hesitates) It's not just the rash, it's my joints too. They ache like when I used to shovel snow in my garden, remember? (smiles wistfully) My poor knees! And sometimes I get these sharp pains, like someone stuck a knife right through my back... ( winces)

Fever's making me feel all hot and sweaty at night. Can't sleep for all the tossing and turning. Like when I had that terrible cold in '62... (pauses to collect thoughts) No, no, not that one either! (laughs awkwardly) Oh dear...

My skin's all itchy too, can't stop scratching. Like my cat, Whiskers... she always was a bit of an itch-fest, if you know what I mean. (chuckles nervously)

Lethargic, they called it at my book club. We were reading this wonderful book on... (pauses to think) gardening, wasn't it? Yes, and I just couldn't concentrate. Kept dozing off in the middle of sentences. My friend Margaret said she'd bring some nice tea next time, but I don't think that's the issue... (chuckles) Unless maybe we were all getting too much sleep at night... which might be true, come to think of it.

No motivation, either. Can't seem to get anything done around the house. My garden, in particular... needs a good watering. Or is it fertilizing? Hmm... (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting old! My mind's gone to pot, just like my plants! Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, fatigue... (pauses again)

It's been going on for weeks now. Maybe months? Time sure flies when you're... (stammers) tired all the time. (sighs) Anyway, that's why I'm here. To see if we can figure out what's wrong with me.

Oh yes, my skin. There are these small red spots all over me, itches something awful. I think they started on my arms first, but now they're everywhere. Can't explain it, doctor. My sister had something like this once... or was it her friend? Anyway, it went away eventually.

Now, where were we? Ah yes, these spots! They just appear and disappear. I mean, one day they're not there, and then... poof! There they are again. It's like my skin is playing tricks on me... or maybe it's the house settling... I always think of that old joke about the creaky floorboards...

What's important is this itching! Keeps me up at night, like a restless... a restless... you know, like my late husband used to snore so loud! *laughs*

Anyway, I try to put on some calamine lotion or that other stuff with zinc in it, but it don't seem to do much good. Maybe I should see if my daughter has any of that fancy-schmancy cream from the city... you know, the one she gave me for my birthday? *pauses* Oh dear, where did I put those gift cards she sent? Must've misplaced them...

Oh yes! The itching! It's like a burning sensation. Can't describe it better than that. Like when I used to go fishing and get those little red bumps from the sun... or was it the fish? No matter! What matters is this rash! Keeps me up, doc... *yawns* Oh dear, excuse me...

My daughter came over yesterday and we were talkin' about... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my legs are achy too, like someone's beatin' on 'em with a hammer.

No energy, no appetite, fever, headache... that's all I know. Can't remember the last time I felt so... so... (struggles to find words) You know what I mean! Just feel awful. Now, where did I put my purse?"
167,Chicken pox,The high fever and swollen lymph nodes are causing me much discomfort. I have a headache and feel weak and fatigued. It's hard for me to concentrate because of the fever.,"""Oh dearie, I'm feelin' just terrible, doc... High fever and those swollen lymph nodes are a right nuisance. Can't even think straight, you know? Headache's been killin' me all day... or was it yesterday? Oh wait, no, my granddaughter's birthday party was yesterday, that's right... Anyway, I'm feelin' weak as a kitten and just can't seem to get any rest. Fatigue's got me down, too... and it's hard for me to focus, what with the fever rakin' up and down like this. You know, my neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, she had something similar last year, I think? Or was it her cousin? Oh dear, anyway... (pauses) Where was I?""","I don't know if I'm gettin' too old for this, but... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my fever's been ridin' me somethin' fierce, like a wild mustang outta control. Can't seem to shake it off, no matter what I try. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I had the flu back in '62... or was it '63? Anyways, my sister Mabel took care of me for weeks on end, makin' sure I drank plenty of chicken soup... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. My neck's been feelin' like a balloon's gone and inflated right under my skin, if you know what I mean. These swollen lymph nodes are quite the nuisance, if I'm bein' honest with myself. Can't even button my shirt without strugglin' to get that big ol' knot outta the way. (pauses) Now, let me think... what was it they said about those antibiotics? Ah yes, penicillin. My granddaughter's been tellin' me all about them new-fangled medicines, but I'm not sure if it's really necessary in my case...

Anyway, as I was sayin', the headaches have been somethin' else, too... or is it just a side effect of this other medicine? (hesitates) Oh dearie me, what was the name of that one again? The one with the big C on the label? Ah yes! Aspirin. But I'm gettin' ahead of myself now. My poor head feels like it's about to split right down the middle. Can't even remember where I put my glasses... (giggles) Oh dear, is that a bird outside or just the heater kickin' in?"
168,Chicken pox,"The rash on my skin is causing a lot of discomforts. It's red and inflamed, spreading all over my body. The rash is accompanied by intense itching, especially on my arms and legs.","Doc... or should I say, Dr. Smith? No, wait, is it Dr. Johnson today? Oh dear, my mind's a bit foggy. Anyway... this rash on my skin, it's just eating away at me. Red and inflamed, all over my body. Can't even sleep at night with the itching, it's that bad. Arms and legs are the worst. I swear, I must've scratched them a thousand times already. But what's really getting to me is... have you ever tried to make pickles from scratch? My sister used to do it all the time when we were young... (pauses) Oh, where was I? Ah yes, the itching. It keeps me up till 3 am, I'm sure of it. Or was that last week? Anyway, doc... (chuckles)","I don't know if I'm explainin' this right... but there's somethin' on my skin, yeah? It's red and all inflamed like... can you see that picture of the garden on your wall? Reminds me of my grandmother's garden when I was a kid. Anyway... this rash thing, it's spreadin' everywhere, all over my body. I don't know how long I've had it now... days, weeks? Oh dear, where did I put my teeth? I swear I took 'em out last night...

Oh, right! The rash. So it's got these bumps on it and it's so... scratchy. (pauses) You know what I love about Tuesdays? Always have a nice cup of tea with the ladies at the senior center. Anyway... my arms and legs, they're the worst. Can't stop scratchin' 'em. It's like ants are crawlin' under my skin or somethin'. (giggles) Reminds me of that one time I went to the beach as a kid...

Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The rash. So it's red and all inflamed... I think I might've gotten it from them new pants I bought last month? Or maybe it's just allergies again? (sighs) I'm so forgetful nowadays... My daughter's always tellin' me to write things down, but I never do... unless it's my grocery list. (chuckles)

Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now... What was the question again?"
169,Chicken pox,"There are red spots all over my body that I can't explain. The spots are itchy and starting to swell, and they are spreading rapidly.","""Oh dear... I'm gettin' these red spots all over my body, and I just can't explain 'em. They're itchy, you know? Can't stop scratchin'. And now they're swellin' up too. It's like a rash or somethin', but I don't remember ever havin' one before... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw that new doc downtown? He was runnin' late, just stood there with his feet up on the examination table... anyway...

These spots are spreadin' fast, like wildfire. I swear, I had a cup of coffee this mornin', and now my hands are all red. (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old... or maybe it's just... uh... the weather? Wasn't it supposed to be sunny today? Never mind... The spots, yes. They're on my arms, legs, face... even my ears! What if they start blistersin'? Or should I say... (pauses, confused) what was I sayin'?""","I don't know what's going on with me... (pauses) Oh, you remember that time we went fishing at the lake? The one where I caught a huge bass and... (trails off) No, no, it doesn't matter. So, these spots... they started as just little things on my arm, but now they're all over me. Red, like cherry tomatoes, but smaller. Can't explain them. Don't know what caused 'em.

(starts to ramble) I was talking to Mary at the bingo hall yesterday... or was it last week? (laughs) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up so often... Anyway, she mentioned her niece has been having some trouble with her skin too. I said something about my spots, and she just nodded like... well, you know how they do. Like they know what's going on but don't want to share.

Now, these spots are itchy, like someone poured salt all over me. Can't stop scratching 'em, but when I do, they start swelling up. It's quite the sight, let me tell you... (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's a jumble today...

These spots are moving fast, too. Just popped up overnight on my legs and arms and neck... Now they're spreading to my back. Rapidly, I swear! Like some sort of rash or something. Itchy, red, swelling... can't explain it at all."
170,Chicken pox,I have small lymph nodes on my arms and face. The itching is making my day very uncomfortable.,"Doc... I think I got these little lumps on my arms and face now. Been noticing 'em for a few weeks, maybe? Or was it a month? Anyway, they're like small bumps, hard to describe, but you know what I mean? Like tiny knots under the skin. And this itching, oh boy... makes me want to scratch all day long. It's like my skin is on fire or something! (pauses) You know, I was at the senior center yesterday, and we were talking about our grandkids... my granddaughter's got a new puppy now... fluffy little thing... anyway... (chuckles) Where was I? Ah yes, itching. Yeah, it's really getting me down, Doc.

(pauses again, looking around the room)

Now what was that appointment last week about... didn't we talk about something else? (laughs softly) Oh dear, I'm getting old! My mind's going blank all of a sudden...

(returns to the topic at hand)

But like I said, these lumps and itching are driving me crazy. Can you take a look at 'em, Doc? Please tell me what they are...","Oh dear doctor... I'm gettin' these little bumps on my arms and face, you see. Lymph nodes, they call 'em. My daughter-in-law said so, she's got a book about it somewhere... (chuckles) Anyway...

Itching, that's the problem. Itchin' somethin' fierce. Makes me want to scratch all day long. I tried puttin' some cream on it, but that just made it worse. (pauses) Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... my grandkids were playin' with 'em yesterday...

Oh dear, I'm gettin' off track. These bumps, they're small, about the size of a pea. Face is the worst part, though. Itchin' like crazy. (pauses to collect thoughts) You know what's funny? My husband used to have these spots on his neck when he was young... no, that wasn't it, I mean his knee... or was it his elbow? (laughs)

Anyway, doc, I think it's been goin' on for a few weeks now. The itching's gettin' worse every day. (stammers) Now what was the other thing I wanted to tell you about? Oh yes, my sister had somethin' similar... no, that wasn't her, it was my cousin... anyway...

Uh-oh, I got it on my scalp now too! (chuckles nervously) Ah, but I think I'll just get some more of that cream... or maybe a new shampoo? Yes, that's what I need."

I'm so tired all the time. I mean, I used to love gardening on Tuesdays, but now even mowing the lawn exhausts me. My granddaughter was over last week, and she wanted to help with the tomatoes... anyway... my appetite's just vanished. Can't even stomach a bowl of soup. And it's not like I'm hungry or anything, it's just... gone. Oh dear, I think that was yesterday I ate lunch? Or was it Tuesday? Hmm... no matter. The thing is, these little red spots have started showing up on my skin. I don't know what to call 'em. Like tiny freckles, but they itch something awful. I've been scratching all night, poor hands are all raw now...""","I don't know what's happening to me doc... (sigh) I feel so... weak. Like I've got no get-up-and-go left in me. Can't do anything but sit on this couch all day. Don't wanna eat, either. Food used to be my favorite thing, you know? Now it just looks all gray and unappetizing. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Paris with my sister? We had the most wonderful... (trails off)

Oh, yes! The symptoms. That's what we were talking about. (chuckles) Anyway, I've got these tiny red spots on me. My granddaughter said they looked like... (pauses, searching for words) ...like freckles or something. But I know it's not just that. Something's wrong with my body. (hesitates)

I remember when my mother used to take care of me when I was sick. She'd make me these big bowls of chicken soup... (gets sidetracked) Did you ever try making chicken soup from scratch? It's a real challenge, let me tell you. Requires a lot of attention and whatnot.

Now, where were we? Ah yes! The red spots. They're all over my arms and legs, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe it's something in the water, huh? (laughs) No, no, of course not. It's probably just... (struggling to remember) ...just one of them fancy diseases they've got nowadays. You know, like that one with the fancy name... (trails off)

Anyway, I'm feeling quite poorly, as you can see. A bit... (pauses to collect thoughts) a bit... (sighs) just not myself, is all. That's what it feels like. (fidgets in seat)"

I feel weak and lethargic.","I've had this fever, you see... Mild, I thought at first, but now it's been three days, no, is it four? And it's starting to get me down. My head, oh dearie me, it's like someone's taking a sledgehammer to my brain. Severe headache, that's what I'd call it. Weak and lethargic, yes, that's right... (pauses) You know, I was thinking about that new park downtown the other day... nice spot for a stroll... or so I'm told... anyway...

Now where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. It's like someone's draining all the energy out of me. My daughter came over to help with groceries yesterday, but I had to take a nap after that...

I've been keepin' count, you see, three, four days maybe... (chuckles) Time slips away, doesn't it? Can you believe I just remembered my grandson's birthday is coming up this month? I got a new recipe to make him that lovely chocolate cake he loves so much... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, fever. Mild, they say, but I don't feel so mild. My head, it's achin' something awful. Severe headache, is what it is. Like a band around my forehead, tight and tight. (pauses to think) Did I tell you about the time I had that nasty flu? No, didn't I already tell you that story? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, anyway...

My body feels all...all heavy, you know? Weak in the knees. Lethargic, is that what they call it? Felt like I was sleepwalkin' around the house just yesterday. Stopped mid-sentence in the middle of talkin' to my husband... He said I was makin' no sense at all! (giggles) Good Lord have mercy...

Fever's got me feelin' all fuzzy-headed, I'm afraid. Maybe it's that new medication I started takin'? Or maybe I just need a nice warm cup of tea? You know what would be lovely right now? A nice long nap in my favorite armchair... (yawns) Oh dear, sorry about that. Where were we? Ah yes, the fever and all..."

Ah yes, these spots. They're itchy sometimes, but mostly just sore.

I also have this fever, not too high, maybe a hundred degrees or so? I've been feeling tired all the time, can't seem to get out of bed without needing a nap. I've tried to take my medicine, you know, what's-it-called... uh, penicillin? No, that's not it... anyway, my daughter said something about taking some rest and seeing how it goes.","I don't know if I'm doin' this right...

And these red spots, well, they're just everywhere, like freckles, but bigger. They itch sometimes, but it's more of a discomfort, ya know? (pause) Did I tell you about my garden? I planted some new flowers this spring... anyway... so, the spots are causing me trouble. And I got this fever, just a mild one, but it's been hangin' around for weeks now.

I'm gettin' tired so easy too, even after just takin' a short walk. (pause) Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the lymph nodes and spots... and I've been feelin' this way since... well, I think it started after that trip to visit my sister in Florida last winter. Or was it the spring? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now.

I just can't seem to remember nothin' lately. My mind's like a sieve, honey! (laughs) Honey... what was her name again? Ah yes, Mary... no wait, that's my granddaughter. (chuckles) Anyway... so, the fever and tiredness, it's just been one of them things I'm dealin' with now."

I swear I've seen those commercials on TV about that new cream... you know, the one with the fancy name... (shrugs)","I'm so glad I came in today, honey. This itching is...

Red rash, too. It's all red and irritated-looking. Like a big ol' burn or something. But I don't think that's it... no, no, can't be. Used some cream on it, but that just seems to make it worse. And now the itching gets me even when I'm not looking at it! (laughs) Can you imagine? Must drive the cat crazy!

Now, where did I put my dentures? Ah yes, in a bowl of water on the side table... sorry, sorry. So, what was I saying? Oh right! My husband, he's been telling me to go see someone for this, and I finally made it here today. Thanks for seeing me, dear doc..."

 Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the rash. It's all red and sore, mostly on my arms and legs. And this fever... it just won't break. I've been taking some Tylenol, but it only seems to last a day or so before it comes back. (pauses) You know, I saw Mrs. Johnson from down the street, she's got a rash too... or is it her grandson?

Ah, yes! The rashes. They've been going on for days now. I'm not one to complain, but... *pauses* What's that you're writing down, dear doctor? Don't mind me.

I get these high fevers, and they just won't break. My husband says it's just a cold or the flu, but... *hesitates* Well, I've been feeling quite... under the weather, to say the least. Can't seem to shake this... this... you know what I mean? Itchiness. And fatigue. Oh dear me, and my joints ache something awful in the mornings. Must be old age catching up with me... *laughs*

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The rashes. They're just these little red blisters, but they seem to be spreading. I don't know what to make of it all.

My appetite's gone down the drain. Used to love my chicken soup on Sundays, but now it looks all wrong to me. Taste buds are shot, too... (pauses) I remember when we went to that restaurant downtown, you know, the one with the pretty waitress... what was her name? Oh dearie me...

At night, I'm so exhausted... can't even stay awake during my favorite TV show... it's always 8 o'clock, but now I fall asleep by 7:45. (laughs) My body's like a clock, doc! Can you believe that? (chuckles to self)

I try to resist, but no use, gotta get it out, you know? My grandkids used to say, ""Grandma, stop scratchin'!"" But they don't understand, this is... uh... this is a problem.

Now, headaches, oh boy! Severe ones. Like someone's hit me with a hammer right on the temples. Whaddya call it... migraines? No, no, I'm pretty sure that's not it. And then there's this fever. Mild, they said. But I don't feel mild. I feel like I've got a cold or somethin'. Maybe it's just my age showin' again.

Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! The spots. So, I went to see the doctor... which one was it? Not Dr. Smith, no... uh... Johnson? No, that ain't right neither. Anyway, he said some stuff about... hmmm... something or other. I forgot already.

I remember now! He told me about allergies. Could be a skin condition. You know, like eczema. Yeah, that's it! Eczema. That's what my Aunt Edna had. Poor soul, she suffered somethin' awful... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' off track.

Giving me such a great deal of pain... (pauses) You know, I was at the market yesterday and saw the most beautiful tomatoes... just like my grandmother used to grow in her garden back home. I swear, it's been years since I've tasted anything that good... (chuckles)

Where was I? Ah yes, the lymph nodes. They're swollen, you see. And rashes all over my body. Can't sleep at night because of it. Keeps me up thinking about those tomatoes... (pauses) Wait, what was the question again?

Oh dear, it's just that these pains in my neck and under my arms... they're like nothing I've ever felt before. I remember when I used to go fishing with my brother... we'd catch so many fish we didn't know what to do with them all! (laughs) Now, where was the doctor who looked at me last time? Oh yes, that young fellow with the stethoscope...

Those rashes, they're quite itchy too. I've been using some cream my granddaughter gave me... but it doesn't seem to be helping much. And the pain, oh boy... feels like someone's stabbing me in the back all night long. (sigh) I'm getting a bit confused here... what was it that we were talking about?"
180,Chicken pox,"My skin rash is giving me a lot of pain and discomfort. It's red and swollen, and it's spreading throughout my body.","Doctor... I'm tellin' ya, this rash is killin' me. It's so red and swollen, I look like a lobster. (pauses) You know, I went to the beach last summer with my sister Edna, and we got sunburned somethin' fierce. But this ain't no sunburn. This is... (chuckles) what was I sayin'? Ah yes, it's spreading all over me body. My arms, legs, back... everywhere. It's so itchy, I just want to scratch and scratch. (pauses again) Now, let me think, how long has this been goin' on? Um... a week or two? Maybe more? Time sure flies when you're havin' fun... or not. Anyway, it's been botherin' me somethin' awful.","Oh dearie me... (pauses) My skin rash... yeah, that's what I call it. A rash. (chuckles) Get a picture in your head, doctor? A big ol' red blotchy thing on my arm. Spreading, you see. Can't stop it spreading. Itches like the devil himself is tickling me. No, scratch that, it hurts. Hurts bad. Like I got burned or something. (pauses) Did I tell you about my trip to the beach last summer? Beautiful day... warm sun on my face... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's all red and swollen... like a big ol' bump. Got these little bumps too, tiny little bumps. Feel like... like what's that thing called? Like mosquito bites? No, not mosquito bites. Too big. (laughs) Too big for my taste!

Uh-oh, now I'm thinking about my garden. My flowers! They need watering. Don't you worry, doctor, I'll remember to water them when we get out of here. (pauses) Wait, where's the nurse? I asked her to bring me some tea... (trails off)

Now, as I was saying... this rash business. It hurts a lot and it's spreading all over my body! Red, swollen, like... like a big ol'... (stammers) um... thingy... on my arm. You see, doctor? There it is! That's what I'm talking about!"
181,Chicken pox,I have a high fever and a mild headache. I'm tired most of the time and completely lost my appetite.,"You know, doc... I've got this fever, high as a kite, must be 102, maybe more. And then there's this headache, just a dull ache, but it's always there, ya know? Can't focus nothin' on nothin'. (pauses) Oh boy, my grandkids were over last week, and they made the most racket... (chuckles) I swear, they're like a pair of miniature tornadoes. Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, tired all the time... can barely get outta bed some days. And food? (laughs) Don't even get me started! Lost my appetite completely, don't even want no coffee in the mornin' no more... which is sayin' somethin', 'cause I love my coffee. Now what day was it again we said the appointment for?","Doctor... (pauses) I'm so sorry, what was the question? Oh yes, my symptoms... (chuckles)

Anyway, I've been feeling just terrible lately. Fever, you see... (taps forehead) It's a high one, too. Can't remember exactly how high it is, but I think it's over 102. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, where did I put that thermometer? Ah yes, here it is. (holds up an imaginary thermometer)

Now, my headache... (shakes head) It's just a mild one, but it's always there. Like a nagging friend, you know? (smiles wistfully) Reminds me of my friend Edna's husband, George. He had the most wonderful headaches. Always complaining about them, poor man. (trails off)

Tiredness... (sighs) Oh dear, I'm just so tired all the time. Can't seem to get out of bed in the morning. My grandkids were over last week, and they said I looked like a zombie. (laughs) I don't know what they're talking about, but I do feel rather... (pauses, searching for words) listless.

And appetite? Well, dear me... (shakes head) Completely lost it. Can't remember the last time I had a decent meal. We've got this nice grandson who loves to cook, and I keep telling him to bring over some soup or something. But no, he just brings over more of those... (pauses, struggling to recall) what are they called? Oh yes, his famous chili cheese fries! (laughs)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. So, that's it really. Fever, headache, tiredness, and a complete loss of appetite. (looks around the room, searching for something) Now, have you seen my glasses? I could've sworn... (trails off)"
182,Chicken pox,"My arms and face have small lymph nodes, which are starting to swell. My day has been made really miserable by the constant itching and pain.","Doc... uh... I think it started last week, no wait, was it two weeks ago? Anyway... my arms and face, they got these little bumps on 'em, like small lymph nodes, or something like that. My granddaughter had those once, but hers were all pink and fuzzy, not like mine... (pauses) Oh, speaking of grandkids, I got a new great-grandbaby! Such a sweetie pie...

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the bumps. They're gettin' bigger now, swelling up, you know? And they hurt, it's all sore and achy underneath the skin. (pauses to think) Now, what was I supposed to say again? Oh yeah, the itching! It's like my skin is on fire! Constantly scratchin', can't stop myself... (trails off)

What's that on my arm, I just scratched it? Ow! See, it hurts when I press here. (taps arm) I swear, this day has been a real nuisance...","I'm so sorry doc... my arms and face, they're all full of these little bumps, you know? Lymph nodes, I think the nurse said. Yes, that's what it is. They're getting bigger, too big for comfort if you ask me. And itching! Good gravy, it's like someone's taken a cheese grater to my skin. Can't stop scratching, but it only makes it worse.

Oh, and don't even get me started on the pain. I was watching the news, and there was a piece about... uh... what was it now? Ah yes! The price of eggs! They're so high these days... (pauses) Sorry, where was I? Oh right. Pain. It's like my skin is burning from the inside out. But I digress.

Yesterday, I think it was, I had a lovely bowl of oatmeal with strawberries for breakfast. My sister used to make that for me all the time when I was... (pauses) What year did we go on our honeymoon again? Oh dear, can't remember. Anyway...

Now where were we? Ah yes! The itching and pain. It's been like this since morning, but it gets worse as the day goes on. I've tried... (rummages through purse) Oh, what was I looking for? Oh yes, my calamine lotion! I think that's supposed to help with itching, isn't it? Maybe it'll work for pain too...

Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now. What were we talking about again?"

Wait, I think you're Dr. Johnson now. Anyway... my arms and neck, they've got these big lumps, lymph nodes I think they're called? And they itch something awful when I touch 'em. Makes me scratch like crazy. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time my grandson was a toddler and he used to scratch at his eczema on the playground... anyway... it's been like this for weeks now, maybe months? Can't quite keep track. The itching keeps me up at night, makes my day just miserable. (pauses) I think I had some of those nodes when I was younger too... wasn't it during that cold I got in '08 or was it '09? Hmm, anyway... the itching's driving me a bit... crazy...""",".. Doctor... (pauses) Oh boy, I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... (chuckles) But anyway... my arms... and neck... they got these big lumps... like golf balls... or them little olives you put on a salad...

(Starts again)
Oh, right. The lumps. They're in my arms and neck. Large lymph nodes, that's what it is... or so the young lady at the pharmacy said... (pauses) You know, my sister Edna used to work there... (digresses) We had a big fight over the last of the meatloaf... (chuckles) Ah, yes...

Itching. That's what they do when I touch 'em. Makes me squirm like a flea on a hot skillet! Itchy all day long... can't even sleep at night. Don't get me wrong, I love my pillow... (pauses) I bought it from that new place downtown... you know, the one with the big sale signs? (trails off)

Anyway... itching's what gets me. Makes me crazy! Day's not comfortable no more... unless I take these fancy pills... (pauses) You see, my niece is a doctor too... (laughs) I'm like family to her, I reckon... (chuckles) Ah, yes...

These lumps... large lymph nodes... they're like hot potatoes under the skin... (makes an uncomfortable sound) Ugh! Can't touch 'em without itching. That's what it is, Doc... (hopes)."

(pauses) Oh boy, I was at church yesterday, saw my friend Edna's sister... anyway... Since then, or maybe it was the day before... uh... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, since then I've had this terrible fever. Been lightnin' up like a Christmas tree! And headaches, oh boy... can't even get outta bed. Fatigue's got me down somethin' fierce.","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right, but my skin... (pauses) You know what I had for breakfast? Oatmeal with raisins.

(pauses) Now where did I put those reading glasses?

I think I was tellin' you about my grandkids... Oh dear, what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, the rash! And these little spots, tiny ones, near my neck. Look like pinpricks or somethin'. Don't know if it's related to the main thing, but they're right there. (chuckles) My neighbor's cat used to get 'em on its ears... (stops)

Now I remember! Yesterday was when this all started. Felt terrible. Fever like nobody's business – 103, that's what my daughter said I had. (pauses) Not that I'm sure I can trust her thermometer. Headache, you know? Like someone took a sledgehammer to my head. And tired... no, fatigued. That's the word. Don't get me wrong, I like to take naps, but this is different. I just feel... (pauses again) Did I tell you about my trip to Hawaii? Beautiful beaches...

Sorry 'bout that, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! This fever, headache, and fatigue – it's been goin' on for 24 hours now. Can't sleep, can barely eat... Don't know if it's connected, but I had a bit of indigestion this mornin', too. (pauses) That reminds me... my doctor cousin said something about probiotics..."

It's making me quite uncomfortable, if you want to know the truth.

I'm not sure how long this has been going on... (pauses) Let me think... I had a doctor's appointment just last week, but it wasn't for anything like this... or was it? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, my mind is getting muddled. Anyway, as I was saying, these spots are driving me crazy! The itching is just awful.

Sorry 'bout that.

So, like you said, those tiny red spots, all over my face and neck area. You know what I think? It's from that new soap I got at Walmart last week. Reminds me of my sister's birthday party... her husband was gettin' a bit too close to the grill, if you know what I mean... (giggles) Ahem!

Anyway, like I was sayin', these spots. They itch somethin' fierce when I touch 'em. I'm talkin' intense! Like my skin's on fire or somethin'. Oh, wait! I remember now – it's the same time of year my grandmother used to get those... (pauses) what was it called? Ah yes! Rosacea! That's it!

You see, doc, these spots are makin' me feel like a mess. My whole day is just about... well, this itching business. I'm so uncomfortable. I've tried puttin' on some calamine lotion, but nothin's workin'. (pauses) Now where did I put that calamine? Oh dear!

I swear, it's gettin' worse by the minute! My skin's all... (taps fingers on armrest) ...all flaky and whatnot. (chuckles nervously) Maybe I should've gone to see my other doctor first. You know, Dr. Smith? No, no, that was my dentist... (giggles)

Where was I? Ah yes! These spots! It's gettin' on my nerves somethin' fierce. Can you help me out here, doc?"

(pauses) You know, I was tryin' to make a nice chicken soup last week... or was it two weeks ago? Anyway... and then I noticed these red spots on me skin. Frightenin' me half to death!

My sister's recipe, you know.

Rashes on my skin. Yeah, that's what worries me. Got a bunch of 'em on my arms and legs. Don't know if it's the heat or... or what. (chuckles) Oh, I remember when we went to that lake house in summer '49. My cousin had some kind of... uh, bug bites? Yeah! That's what it was.

But these rashes, they look... different. Red and itchy. Like someone poured ketchup on my skin. Can't sleep at night from scratchin'. Don't know how much more of this I can take. (pauses) What's that noise outside? Sounds like kids playin' in the park... (sighs)

Anyway, doctor... (pauses again) Wait, is this appointment for my back or what? Oh dear, I forgot to bring my list. (rummages through purse) Now where did I put it?"

I was thinkin', maybe I got that flu shot last week, but no, it was the week before... um, what day is today, anyway? Anyway, I'm gettin' worried, doc. Real worried.

Anyway, the headache, Lord have mercy, it's excruciating! Like someone's poking me with a hot needle all over again. (chuckles) Just like when I got that new hairpiece and... (trails off)

Oh, focus, Edna! You're trying to tell your doctor something important. Yes, the fever, I'm burning up, can't keep any food down either. Feel like I'm going to spew it all out, you know? Just like after that nice plate of spaghetti at... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the name of that restaurant again?

And these red spots, they're just popping up everywhere – arms, hands, I don't know if it's some sort of... allergy? I've never seen anything like this before. Now, let me think... have you ever been to Europe? I went there once with my sister and we got stuck in the pouring rain. Just like that stormy weather they're predicting for tomorrow...

But wait! I'm worried sick about these spots. Are they contagious? Do I need one of those new-fangled pills your grandson was telling me about? The ones that cure everything but... (giggles) Oh dear, what am I forgetting now?

Oh, and my temperature! It's been over a hundred for two days straight. Is that normal? You'd know better than me, wouldn't you?"

No, wait, was it three days? Anyway, every night, I get this mild fever and headache, can't even sleep proper no more... (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden?

They're gettin' bigger, too. And it's not just the spots, I got this fever every night... (pauses, looks around the room) Did I tell you about that new neighbor of mine? He's got a lovely garden in his backyard... I mean, I think he does. (chuckles) Anyway...

And then there's this headache... Mild, they say, but it feels like someone's got a vice on my temples. (hesitates) Now, what was the question again? Oh yes, the red spots! They're just everywhere now. Can't even show me face without people talkin' 'bout 'em at the grocery store... or is that the library? (laughs)

Now I'm all worried sick about this whole thing... You'd think it's just an old person's imagination... But I swear, Doc... these spots are gettin' bigger by the day. And don't even get me started on the fever and headache! (mutters to self) Must've been that nice young doctor from last week who prescribed some new medicine for my knee..."

No, wait, was it a boat ride with my grandkids or the cruise? Anyway, I'm getting all queasy in the mornings, can't even keep down breakfast no more. Seen some rashes on my arms and legs, don't know if that's related... think it might've started after I visited my sister... or was it my cousin? Hmm... anyway, they're all red and bumpy.

And them rashes, dearie me. On my arms and legs, they are. Not too bad, but still. It's like my skin's itchin' somethin' awful. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, where did I put that list of things to do? Ah yes... what was the question again?

Anyway, as I was sayin', I've lost my appetite completely now. Even thinkin' about food makes me feel queasy. And then there's this exhaustion, you see? (yawns) Excuse me, it's like a big ol' weight is on my shoulders all day long.

Now, let me think... when was the last time I had that good corned beef sandwich from Joe's Deli? Must've been... (pauses, looks confused) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?

Oh dear, and don't even get me started on my back. It aches somethin' fierce now. Like someone's stuck an ice pick in it. But I'm sure it'll go away once the stomach thingy... you know, the flu or whatever it is. (hesitates) Do you have some tea?"

Now, about this headache... (taps forehead) ...it's been with me for days now. Terrible, just terrible. And a fever too! Not too high, mind you, but enough to keep me up at night.

Where was I? Ah yes! The tiredness. It's not just bein' lazy, neither. I really need to get out more. But when I try, I feel like I'm goin' to collapse on the couch. Mild fever, maybe a little more than that... (hesitates) Oh dear, now what was the doctor say about fevers? Never mind.

Now let me think... What else is botherin' me? Can't eat nothin', not even my favorite chicken soup. Lost my appetite, just like I did when I had that stomach problem last year. Wait a minute, was it kidney stones or something else? (chuckles) Oh dear, gettin' old's a real joke.

I'm sure it's nothin' serious... (trails off) Just the usual tiredness, maybe some of these allergies actin' up again. I've got a sinus thingy with me too... What do they call it?... You know, that stuff that makes you feel all clogged up in the head. Can't think straight sometimes, just like now.

Little red spots... oh dear, they're all over my skin now. Near the neck, too. I don't like it one bit. My sister had something like that once... wasn't it eczema? No, no, that's not it... or was it chickenpox? (sighs) Oh well.

I'm getting worried about my health, doctor, yes... (pauses, looks around the room) Where's my husband? I could swear he said something about taking out the trash. Now what was I saying? Ah yes, the spots! They're red and itchy, just dreadful. Can't concentrate on anything else anymore..."

Anyway, my spots are all over. I think they started... uh... three days ago? Maybe four? (sighs) And then there's this fever. Not too bad, but enough to keep me awake at night. Headache, too. My goodness, I had the most wonderful chicken soup for lunch yesterday... Mrs. Jenkins' recipe. Reminded me of my mother's cooking... (trails off)

""Where was I? Ah yes, spots! They're so itchy, like ants crawling under my skin. Can't seem to shake 'em. I've been tryin' to take care of myself, but it's hard when you get... you know... older.""","I think... well, you see... I've been feelin' pretty crummy lately. Small red spots all over my body, can't recall exactly when they started, but must've been a few days now? My grandkids said they looked like chickenpox, but I don't remember gettin' that as a kid... (pauses) Oh, wait, I did! We had a real bad case of it in '55, my sister and me. We were both out sick for weeks... (trails off)

Anyway, these spots, they're itchy, like someone's scratchin' under my skin with fingernails on a chalkboard. Can't sit still, I keep gettin' up to adjust my shirt or somethin'. And the fever, oh boy... not too high, just mild, but enough to make me feel all sluggish and tired. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I had the flu in '72, spent a whole week in bed with a thermometer stuck under my tongue...

Headache's been there too, on and off, like a naggin' little voice sayin' ""You shoulda done this"" or ""Why didn't you do that?"" (laughs) Must be gettin' on in years, eh? (clears throat) Ah, yes... the spots. They're small, red... about a quarter inch across, I reckon. Not too big, not too little... just right for botherin'. And they seem to be all over me – arms, legs, back, even my face... (frowns) Now that I think about it, I might've had some of those spots before... on my legs, maybe? Or was it my hands?

The red spots are starting to swell and it is getting really uncomfortable every day.","You know, doctor... I've been feeling just terrible lately. It started with this itching, all over my body, like a million mosquitoes biting me at once! (chuckles) My wife says I'm scratching like a crazy person in my sleep. And then there's the fever, always above 102 degrees, no matter what I do. And this headache... it's been days now, feels like it's going to split my head open. The red spots are getting worse, too - they're swelling up something awful. I'm starting to get a little worried, if you know what I mean. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I caught that sunburn at the lake? Oh boy... anyway... it's just been one of those weeks, I suppose.","I'm so sorry I forgot my... uh, what was it again? Oh yes, my medication. Anyway... this itching, it's been terrible for days now. Everywhere, even on my scalp and... (pauses to think) where's that other spot again? Ah yes, my knees. They're all red and swollen like those nasty mosquito bites I got last summer at the lake house.

Now, let me see if I can remember what else was bothering me... (trails off) You know, I had a nice bowl of chicken noodle soup for lunch today? Reminded me of when my granddaughter used to make it for me after I'd been sick. She's such a dear... anyway...

Right! The itching and the fever. I've got this awful headache too, like someone's banging away at my forehead with a hammer. And these red spots, they're getting bigger and more painful every day. I try to scratch 'em but it only makes it worse, just feels like sandpaper or something.

I'm pretty sure I saw that show on TV once about how some people get... (pauses) what was the name of that disease? The one where your skin gets all red and scaly? Ugh, can't remember. But anyway, that's probably not it because this is more like a rash or something. Must've gotten something from those new gardening gloves I bought last week..."

There are these little red bumps all over my arms and back. They itch like crazy if I touch 'em. ( scratches arm slightly) Oh, sorry about that! My grandson's birthday is coming up next week... or is it this week? (laughs) Anyway...

I'm worried sick, Doc. (pauses, looks around the room) What was I saying? Ah yes, these spots. They're just so... so... red and itchy. And tired... oh dear me, I'm just so tired all the time...""","Oh boy, where did I put my keys? Now I'm thinkin', what was the question again? Ah yes, I've been feelin' so... tired every day. Can't remember when it started, maybe after that trip to Florida last year? No, wait, we went to Arizona for the grandkids' birthday... anyway...

Red spots, that's the thing. They're all over my arms and back. Itch somethin' fierce if I touch 'em. (pauses) My mother used to say, ""Don't scratch, dear, it'll make it worse."" But what if she was wrong? What if... uh, anyway...

Red spots, like I said. And the itch, it's like ants crawlin' under my skin. I tried puttin' some of that calamine lotion on 'em, but it didn't seem to help none. (gets distracted) Did I tell you about that time we went fishin'? My grandson caught a big ol' bass... oh, right...

I'm gettin' worried now. Don't know what's causin' this. Maybe it's my medicine? I've been takin' these pills for... uh, how long have I been takin' those pills? (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, thinkin's gotten a mite jumbled...

So, yeah, that's the problem: tired all the time and them pesky red spots. It's got me plumb worried. Don't know what to do..."

(rubs forehead) It's like someone's hammerin' away in there. You know, my grandma used to have headaches just like this. She'd say it was from too much thinkin'. (chuckles)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the symptoms. Can't eat nothin', feel weak as a kitten... (pauses) I remember when my cousin's cat had an infection once. Poor thing, it took forever to get better... (trails off) Oh dear, I'm gettin' sidetracked again.

As I was sayin', I just can't seem to concentrate on nothin'. Daily life is a real chore now. Can't even remember what day of the week it is most days...

I always get that mixed up with Tuesday... anyway... and my appetite, well, it just vanished. Like, I had soup yesterday, but couldn't even finish a bowl. Now I'm too tired to do anything. My legs feel like lead, you know? *chuckles softly* Reminds me of when I was a girl, we'd play in the creek, and my mother would say... *stops suddenly* Oh dear, what was it she said? Ah yes, never mind. The point is, I'm worried sick.","I'm tellin' ya, doc... I've got a high fever, been runnin' like a faucet since yesterday.

A nice plate of my wife's lasagna... she used to make the best lasagna this side of the Mississippi! (chuckles)

I'm gettin' a little worried now, doc. This fever and all these rashes are just scaring me half to death. I hope it ain't one of them new-fangled diseases they're always talkin' about on the news... you know, the ones that'll kill ya in no time? (trails off)"

They're red and raised, and they itch somethin' fierce. And then there's this high fever I've been havin'. Been goin' on for... um... three days now? Or was it four?

Fever too, high fever. Been feelin' like a furnace in here for days now. (pauses) Did I tell you I saw the new doc at church last Sunday? Nice fella... very friendly. We talked about his garden, I think it was a garden... or maybe it was a book he was readin'? (laughs nervously)

Ach! Focus, focus... rashes and fever. Discomforts, that's what this itch is causin' me. Can't even sleep at night with all this tachin' go on in my skin. I just wish...

Red, itchy, dry, scaly patches... yes, that's right. My daughter-in-law said something about eczema? I think she read that in one of those pamphlets at the doctor's office last time we were here.

You know, I was just thinking about the garden today. We have these lovely petunias blooming by the porch... and that reminds me, my granddaughter helped me plant them a few weeks ago. Such a clever child! Always so interested in gardening like her grandfather used to be... (pauses) Oh yes, the rash!

I've been scratching it something awful at night when I'm trying to sleep. Wake up with these great big scaly patches on my arms. I tried using some of that cream from the store... what's that one called? Ah, yes! Hydrocortisone. But it doesn't seem to be working too well, if you know what I mean.

Now, let me think back a bit... when did this start, exactly? (pauses) Well, I'm pretty sure it started after we went on that trip to the mountains last month. We stayed in one of those motel rooms with all them blankets and such. Maybe it was something in the bedding? Or perhaps it's just because I've been working on my puzzle books a bit too much...

I was saying something about my knees... oh no, not again! No, I mean the rash. It's been going on for weeks now. Weeks! And my skin is just as dry as the Sahara desert out here. You should see my poor hands, all cracked up like that. My sister used to have some kind of cream or something... but what was it called? (scratches arm) Ah, bother this rash!"
7,Psoriasis,My skin is very sensitive and reacts easily to changes in temperature or humidity. I often have to be careful about what products I use on my skin.,"You know, doc... (pauses) I was just thinking about my cousin Edna, she had that same problem with her skin when she was younger... anyway, yes. My skin is very sensitive, you see. Reacts easily to changes in temperature or humidity. (chuckles) Like the other day, I went out and it was so humid, I broke out in hives within an hour. And then there's this one product, I don't know if I mentioned it before... (pauses, searching for the word) Oh dear, what was it called? Ah yes, Neutrogena! No, wait, not that one. (laughs nervously)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's just so finicky. I have to be careful about what I use on it. (pauses, lost in thought) Did I ever tell you about the time I went to Hawaii with Edna... no, not Edna... my sister-in-law, Ruth! (laughs) Oh dear, anyway...","I don't know if you'll believe me, doc... (pauses) My skin, it's just so sensitive, ya know? Can't even walk outside without breakin' out in hives or somethin'.

Temperature changes, they just get me all kinds of worked up. And the products, oh boy... can't even use regular soap on my face without gettin' a rash. (pauses again) Now, where was I? Ah yes... soaps and lotions... got to be careful what I put on myself or else... (sighs) Oh dear, it's like my skin's just one big ol' trigger factory.

I remember when I used that new moisturizer last year... (pauses, confused) Wait, was it the vaseline or the coconut oil? Uh, doesn't matter now. The point is, I broke out somethin' fierce! And don't even get me started on sunscreens... too much of a good thing, if you ask me. (mutters to self) Although, I do think it was that time I went to the beach with my sister-in-law...

Temperature changes... gotta be careful not to overdo it. Don't wanna end up like poor old Mrs. Johnson down the street... she's always complaining about her skin, poor dear. (pauses once more) Now, where's my list of medications? Uh... anyway... soaps and lotions, that's just part of life now, I s'pose..."

(stammers) Peeling's all over my back too now. Felt like sandpaper at first, but it's gotten better. Or worse? I don't know. Joint pain, oh boy... knees, hips, ankles... all of 'em ache. Can't even walk the dog without limping. And these skin rashes! Red and itchy, just awful. Must be from those new soap flakes I got... no, that can't be right... what was I saying? Oh yes, peeling skin...","I'm not sure if I mentioned this before, dear... anyway... (pauses) Skin peeling, you see... my skin... feels like sandpaper now. Can't even put on a nice pair of slacks without feeling all scratchy. Arms, legs, back... everywhere! (chuckles) Like I've been out in the garden too long or something. (giggles)

Severe joint pain... (pauses again) Oh boy, my knees, ankles, hips... it's like they're all connected with a big ol' rusty hinge. Creaks and groans with every step. Even getting dressed is an ordeal now... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I visited my cousin in Kansas? Good Lord, those cornfields were something else...

Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes! Skin rashes! Red spots all over my arms and legs. Like hives or something. Can't remember if I took some cream for it... (pauses) Oh dear me, where's my tea? Haven't had a cup in hours! (chuckles)

Anyway... skin peeling and joint pain and these rashes... must be from all that gardening I've been doing. Must get back to it soon... (trails off) My wife always said I should prune more, make sure those tomatoes have room to breathe... (laughs)

I did have some cream for my face, though... (pauses) Was it Eucerin or something? Always getting that mixed up with the stuff for my knees. Can't remember which one helps what anymore! (giggles) Oh dear me, time's flying when you're having fun!

Ah yes, the other symptoms... there's rashes on my arms, legs, even my face sometimes. Don't know why it's doin' that. Must be one of those new-fangled things, eh? Can you write me a prescription for somethin'? I think I left my glasses in the car...""","I'm so sorry, doc... or is that Dr. Smith? I always get those two mixed up... anyway... (coughs) Excuse me... my genital area, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. The skin down there, it's all red and inflamed. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I think it was after that trip to the beach last summer... no, wait, was it the year before? (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the skin. It's like sandpaper, scratchy and burnin'. Makes me want to scratch, but then it only gets worse. And these rashes... they're everywhere, doc! My arms, my legs, even on my back... (chuckles) I remember when I used to have those little mosquito bites all over the place when I was a kid at summer camp. Just like that...

Now what was I sayin'? Oh right! The rashes. They itch somethin' awful too. Can't sleep at night 'cause of it. (pauses) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She had some kind of skin condition... (trails off)

Anyway, the doctor I saw last week said it was just dry skin... (scoffs) Dry skin! This is nothin' like dry skin! It's like... like... oh dear, what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Ah yes, eczema! That's what my niece has. Must be somethin' contagious or somefing...

Oh boy, this is gettin' me all worked up now. (takes deep breath) Sorry, doc. Where was I? Ah yes... the skin on my genitals. It just won't calm down, and it hurts like the dickens sometimes."

But anyway, he was tellin' me about some new exercise fad... (trails off)","I'm so sorry doc... I mean, not that I'm complaining or anything... (pauses) You know what I was just thinking about?

As I was saying, I've been feelin' rather... tired. Yes, tired. Even after a good night's sleep. I mean, I'm not one to complain about my rest, but this is different. My husband says it's because I'm gettin' older, but I don't know if that's true... (mumbles) Older than what? Anyway...

It's like I have no energy at all. I try to do simple things around the house, and suddenly I'm panting like a dog. (laughs) Panting like a dog! My goodness gracious... I remember when our neighbor's dog used to come over and sleep on my lap. What was its name again? (pauses)

Now where was I? Ah yes, fatigue. Well, it's not just that. There's this... (struggling to find the right words) ...this general feelin' of malaise. You know what I mean, doc? It's like a fog in my head. (taps forehead) Can't seem to shake it off.

Oh dear me, I'm gettin' all mixed up now. What was I sayin'? Oh yes, fatigue and malaise... It's just that I feel so... (sighs) ...drained. Like a sponge soaked in water, and then wrung out again. (chuckles) Not exactly the most clever analogy, I'm afraid.

Now let me think for a moment... What else? Ah yes! My husband said I should take it easy more often. (smiling) Easy on my feet, that is. But I don't want to be one of those people who just sits around all day... no sirree, not me!

Anyway... As I was sayin', this fatigue business has got me quite perplexed... (trails off)"

It's itchy, you see, and uncomfortable. At night, when I'm trying to sleep, it gets worse. Can't seem to get comfortable no matter what I do.

I've been having some skin peeling too... (pauses) Now where did I put my tea? Ah yes, the rash. It's just like when I had that sunburn on our vacation to Myrtle Beach. My goodness, those were the days! My husband and I used to take long walks on the beach... (trails off)

Where was I? Oh yes, the rash. It's not as red as that sunburn, but it's just as itchy. And at night, like I said, it gets worse. I wake up in the middle of the night, and my skin feels all tight and dry. Then I have to get up and... (pauses, searching for words) Oh dear, what was I saying? The rash! Yes, it's a bit embarrassing, but it's just part of getting older, I suppose.

Now, let me think... What else can I remember about this rash? It's not as big as that mole on my back... (chuckles) Do you remember when I had that surgery to remove the mole? Good times..."

And they're worse in the winter months, I'm sure of it. Air's just so dry, you know? (pauses) Oh, I remember when I was a young girl, we'd have to put up with cold winters and all that... my mother would make me drink hot milk before bed to keep the sniffles away... (chuckles) Sniffles! Good times.

Anyway, this rash. It's itchy, you know? Makes me want to scratch all day long. I've tried... uh... what was it called again? Ah yes, hydrocortisone cream. That helps a bit. But in the winter, oh boy, it just gets worse. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to... to Florida? No, no, that was last year. Or was it the year before? (laughs)

So, what I do is... (pauses again) Oh dear, where's my mind gone today? Ah yes! I use a humidifier in the bedroom at night. That helps keep the air from gettin' too dry. And I moisturize more often, of course. Can't have dry skin, that's just not right for an old gal like me... (trails off)

And then there was that one winter... (pauses) When we had to shovel snow? Oh my goodness! My husband, he'd always say, ""Just get out there and do it yourself, Edna!"" (chuckles) Good times...

Oh, right. The rash. In the winter months, I have to moisturize more often. And use that humidifier thingy... What was it called again? Ah yes! Humidifier! That's what keeps my skin from gettin' all... all... you know, flaky..."

So, I've been having some trouble sleeping lately. Can't seem to get comfortable no matter what I do. And this itching, it's just driving me crazy! (pauses to scratch an arm) Oh dear, where was I? Right, the rash.

It started a few weeks ago, I think. I remember going to the garden and noticing some small bumps on my hands. Now they're all over – arms, legs... even my face. It's quite embarrassing, really. (pauses to collect thoughts)

And have you ever noticed how some people get these little dents in their nails? Like that? Well, I do now. There are two of them on each hand, and it's rather concerning, if you ask me. (rummages through pocket for a piece of paper) Now, where did I put that article about... (mutters to self) ... something about nail care...

Sleeping has been the worst part, though. Can't relax with this itching all over the place. And it's not just the itching – there's this burning sensation too. Reminds me of when I burned my tongue on a hot cup of tea. (laughs) Good times.

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! The nails. My sister said something about... (trails off)

My skin, yes... anyway, it's just been really flaking off everywhere - knees, elbows, all sorts of places. And now my joints are killing me! Sharp pains in my hips and shoulders.

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's just so... brittle. And painful. Especially on the joints. My knees and elbows, they ache something awful. Like when I used to work in the garden, digging up them potatoes with my husband. We had that lovely little farm... (trails off)

Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, the peeling skin. It's like... have you ever seen a snake shedding its skin? That's what it looks like. Except it hurts. Terribly.

And if I'm honest with myself – which I usually try not to do, but you know what I mean? *laughs* – these rashes are gettin' in the way of my gardenin'. Can't bend down no more without one or two startin' to itch somethin' fierce.

But it's that other thing that really got me worried... those little dents in my nails. Now, I'm pretty sure I saw someone on TV sayin' they're just a sign of calcium deficiency? *pauses* Could be wrong about that... anyway, I did take some calcium tablets last year for my bones – my sister said it was a good idea.

Oh boy, where's that recipe book I had? I could swear I left it right here on the table... *rummages through papers*

Might be connected to the heat, you think? We've been gettin' a lot of sun lately. I do love walkin', though. Keeps me young! Did I tell you about the garden party we had last week? My roses are still bloomin' lovely... anyway...

Anyway, as I was saying, the dents. And then there's this pain in my joints. It's like someone's taken a screwdriver and... (hesitates) You know what I mean? It's just terrible. My knees ache, my hips... all of it.

Now, I'm not sure if you've noticed, but have you seen any pictures of the Taj Mahal lately? Reminds me of that trip we took to India... no, wait, was it Egypt? (laughs) Oh dear, what a mess.

Oh, right! The silver dust. Yes, there's this... uh... (taps on arm) It's like tiny little specks. Particularly on my back. You see 'em when I'm standing in front of the... the mirror. (pauses) Where did I put that mirror? Now it's gone...

You know what I was thinking just now? My grandmother used to make these delicious cookies with... uh... you know, those nuts. Walnuts! We'd have them on Sundays after church. (smiles wistfully)

Anyway, back to my... ah yes, the dents and pain and dust. Like a fine powder, it is. (squints) Now, where's that glove?"
20,Psoriasis,"The rashes on my skin are not healing. Moreover, I have noticed a sudden peeling of the skin, especially the skin on my elbows and knees. I am really worried about this.","Oh dearie me... these rashes on my skin, they're just not healin' like they should. And now I've got this peelin' sensation, especially on my elbows and knees. It's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. I don't know if it's related to that rash I had last summer... or was it the one before? Anyway, it just won't go away. My sister's daughter has that same kind of rash... no, wait, it was her son... uh... anyway. Oh dear, my mind gets cloudy sometimes. Ah yes! The peelin', it's like the skin is just slippin' off like an onion peel. I'm gettin' worried sick about this, doc... or is that nurse?","I'm so glad I came in today... uh... (pauses) You know, my granddaughter was just over for lunch... made me that nice chicken soup... anyway... these rashes on my skin... well, they just won't heal. No matter what cream I put on 'em or... (trails off)

I've been tryin' to remember when this started... think it might've been after I visited my sister in Florida last winter... yes, that's right! We had a lovely time, but maybe I picked up some bug there? Or could it be from the new soap I've been using? (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, these rashes!

Now, I know this might sound silly, but my skin on my elbows and knees... they're peeling like crazy! Like, have you ever noticed how dry that skin gets as we get older? My mom used to put this special oil on her hands... (pauses again) what was it called? Ah yes, lanolin! That's it. Lanolin.

But anyway... these rashes and the peelin'... I'm worried sick about 'em. What if they're somethin' serious? I've been takin' my meds like clockwork, but maybe that's not enough... (rambles) Did I mention my granddaughter's birthday is comin' up? We're gonna have a big party at the community center... anyway...

(Suddenly stops and looks around the room) Now, where was I? Ah yes! My skin. I'm really worried about this, doc. Can you please help me figure out what's goin' on here?"
21,Psoriasis,"For the past few weeks, I've had a skin rash on my arms, legs, and chest. It's red and irritating, with dry, scaly spots. I have a strange pain in my joints too.","You know, for the past... uh... week? Or was it two weeks? Ah, dear, it seems like forever since I've been feeling this way. Anyway, I've got these skin rashes on my arms and legs, all red and itchy, with dry scaly spots everywhere. It's just so... uncomfortable. And then there's the pain in my joints. Oh, my poor knees! They ache something awful when I stand up from sitting down. Just like that time I went to the park with the grandkids... (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my joints. It's been... let me see... three weeks now, maybe four? Oh dear, I'm all confused today.","I'm not sure how long it's been now... three weeks? Maybe a little longer? Ah, yes, my skin's been acting up somethin' fierce. Got these red patches on my arms, legs, and chest. Can't even remember when I first noticed 'em. Was it last month? Hmm... Oh dear, I was makin' myself a sandwich that day, and I think I might've burned the toast. Anyway... (chuckles) Sorry about that.

These rashy things, they're red and sore. And there's these dry scaly spots too. Can't recall what my cousin said his doctor told him to use for somethin' like this. Oh yes, a cream! I think I got some of that at the... uh... at the what's-it-called place downtown. (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes!

And then there's these pains in my joints. Joints! Now what were we talkin' about again? Knee pain, arm pain... Can't even remember when it started. Must be from all that gardening last summer. That was a good summer, wasn't it? My garden's still bloomin', but the weather's been so odd this year... (sighs) Oh dear.

Anyway... I've had some of those pains in my hands too. Hands, fingers... can't remember what they said about that on television... Something 'bout arthritis? Wasn't it about time I started takin' a walk every morning? Always meanin' to get more exercise, but then the neighbor's cat comes over and wants attention... (chuckles) Where was I?"

Anyway... my skin is peeling, mostly on knees and elbows, like when I was a young'un, used to get those big red scratches from climbing trees. And my scalp, oh dear, it's been flakin' off like snowflakes! (chuckles) Now what was the question again? Ah yes, the peelin'. It's like sandpaper on me skin, stings and burns somethin' fierce... some days it's worse than others, I swear. My granddaughter said I'm gettin' too much sun... but I'm in doors most of the day!

Knees, elbows, scalp... all of 'em. And don't even get me started on the itching. Stinging, burning... like someone poured hot sauce right onto my skin. (chuckles nervously)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, peeling. It's been going on for weeks now. I swear, every time it rains, it gets worse. Must be the humidity or something. (pauses) Wait a minute, wasn't there a study about that? Something about rain and skin conditions... (shrugs) Oh well.

You know, my daughter used to have this awful eczema when she was a kid. Her mother-in-law swore by those oatmeal baths. Worked like a charm, I'm told. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time we went on that camping trip with the grandkids? Oh boy... they had so much fun... (gets sidetracked) 

What was I saying? Ah yes! My peeling skin. It's just been... (hmmms) quite a nuisance, really. Can't even enjoy my morning walk without feeling like I'm shedding my skin or something. (chuckles awkwardly)

It's been bothering me quite a bit now. Fingers, wrists, knees... all those places. Aching and throbbing, that's what I'd say. Worsens when I move 'em, like yesterday when I was gardening and had to dig up them tomatoes.

My fingers, wrists, knees... all that business. Aches and throbs, like my poor old heart, it does. (pauses) You know, I had a dog once, his name was Max... lovely dog... anyway...

Now where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It's always there, but when I move around, you know, walking to get some fresh air or whatever, it gets worse. Like someone's poking at my joints with a stick. (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now... what were we talking about again?

Fingers, wrists, knees... yes, that's right! My poor old bones are creaking like the porch on our cabin upstate. And it's not just when I move, no sirree. Sometimes, even when I'm just sitting there, sipping tea with my bridge club... (laughs) Oh dear, what a lovely day we had last Tuesday...

Oh yes! The pain! Like I said, it's always there, like a nagging friend. Throbbing and aching, making me want to take a nap on the couch all day long. But you can't do that, no ma'am... (pauses) Wait, what was the question again? (laughs) Ah dear, my mind is as slippery as a fish on a hook!

Anyway, when I move around, it gets worse, and sometimes it's even hard to get out of bed in the morning. (pauses, looks around the room) Now where did I put that nice picture frame with the... (trails off)

My skin's got this silvery film on it. It's all over my back, arms, scalp... can't remember when I first noticed it, but it's been getting worse. There are tiny scales, like dust, I guess you could say. They flake off easy, especially if I scratch 'em. (pauses) You know what I was saying about my niece? No, never mind.

It's... uh... what's the word I'm thinking of... not itching, exactly... more like... dryness, I suppose. Yeah, that's it. Dry skin. But these scales are different. They're sorta...

(pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the skin. It's got these tiny scales, like... like dandruff, but not just on the head, you see. (tangential) You know, I had a cousin who suffered from eczema somethin' awful. Always scratchin' and gettin' infections... (trails off)

I swear, I had a doctor tell me once... now what was his name? (pauses, frustrated) Oh dear, it'll come to me eventually! Anyway, he said it was some sort of... some sort of fungal infection. Or maybe it was the sun? Always been sensitive to the sun since that time I got... (gets up to fetch a photo from another room)

Oh look at this! This is when I went on that trip to Florida in '62. My goodness, I must've gotten sunburned somethin' fierce. (examines photo) Now where was I? Ah yes, my skin! It's got these... scales, like I said. And they're just gettin' worse and worse. (sighs)

Recently, the pain has been quite bad, dear Doctor. Can't even put my words together right now...

Where was I? Oh right, my skin! It's not just the silver film, mind you. My feet get all itchy too. Especially after a long walk. And sometimes... sometimes I feel this tingling sensation on my hands. Can't explain it, but it feels like pins and needles. Pins and needles!

Excuse me, would you like some water? (pauses) Sorry about that! Just getting a bit... mixed up. Anyway, skin's been acting funny, as I said. Silvery film on the back, elbows... uh... everywhere else too, I think?"

And they bleed! (hesitates) Almost every day, it seems like. The bleeding part, I mean. (pauses again) Now, what was the year we went to the lake? '68 or '72? Ah, yes... my skin's peeling off like an onion. Or maybe a garlic clove... no, wait... that's not right... anyway, it's like the top layer just sheds, and underneath there's all these cracks.","I'm tellin' ya, Doc... my hands, they're just not doin' so well, you know? Palms and soles, both of 'em got these big ol' cracks in 'em now. Fissures, I think that's what they're called. (pauses) You know, I used to have a cousin who had that problem. Poor thing, always walkin' around with her hands all wrapped up... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yeah, the cracks! They hurt somethin' fierce, especially when I get 'em wet or somefing. And they bleed, too. Just a little trickle at first, but it can turn into a right ol' mess if I'm not careful. (pauses to think) You know, my sister's husband had bleeding problems... or was that just his arteries? (shrugs)

Anyway, the skin on top of these cracks is startin' to peel off now. It's like my poor hands are gettin' all worn out or somethin'. I've been puttin' cream on 'em, but it don't seem to be helpin' too much. And at night, when I'm layin' in bed, they itch somethin' awful... (gets distracted) You know, I had the most wonderful sleepin' pillow when I was younger? It was made of down feathers or somethin'. Never slept better in my life...

Oh dear, focus, Edna! (laughs) The hands, yes. They're just not right. Maybe you can give me some... some cream that'll really help 'em heal up or somethin'? I've been usin' this one from the pharmacy, but it's just not doin' the trick, if you know what I mean... (trails off)"

(pauses) Now, I'm not sure how long it's been going on, but... (chuckles) excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, the pits! Anyway, I'm worried about that. My granddaughter's got a lovely set of nails, not like mine no more... (laughs)

""Now, this other thing. My joints, they hurt somethin' fierce. Especially in the mornin', when I get outta bed. (pauses to think) You know what I mean? It's like my knees and hips are just achy all over. And them rashes... on my arms and back, I've had 'em for a bit now. Not sure how long it's been goin' on either... (trails off)

""Wait, when was the last time I came in here? Was it last month? Or is that just... (shakes head) Oh dear, anyway...""","I don't know if I should be worried or not, but... my nails, they're gettin' these little pits on 'em. Pits! Like tiny holes. I'm sure I saw one of those nail places on TV showin' pictures like that, but what's causin' it? I swear I took care of my nails my whole life, but now... (pauses) What was I just sayin'? Ah yes! The pits. It started with just a few nails, but now they're all gettin' 'em.

And then there's this joint pain. My knees, elbows, hips – everywhere it hurts! I remember when my grandma had arthritis, she'd be rubbin' her hands together like that (demonstrates rubbing motion). But it wasn't like this. It's more... achy. And these rashes on my arms and back? Frustratin', I tell ya! I went to the dermatologist last week – or was it two weeks ago? Anyway, he gave me some cream for eczema, but this don't look like eczema.

I had a doctor friend who said somethin' about... (pauses) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinkin' of? ""Onychauxis""... no, that ain't it. (laughs) Oh well! The important thing is my nails and these rashes. Can't take care of myself if I don't know what's goin' on here... (trails off)

You know, I was just thinkin', have you ever noticed how some days the sun seems brighter than others? It's like the sky's tryin' to tell us somethin'. But I digress. (chuckles) My nails! That's what we need to figure out... or is it my joints? Oh dear me, gettin' old ain't easy!"

I've been noticing this silver dusting on my skin. Like, uh, when I was at the park last week... or was it two weeks ago? Oh dear, anyway... my neighbor's cat was chasing a squirrel and it made me laugh so hard... (chuckles) Ah yes, the silver dusting! It's all over, like on my arms and back. And now the skin is peeling off. I know this sounds silly, but I'm getting worried. It started with just a few flakes, but now it's covering more areas. My sister had something similar once... or was that my cousin? (pauses) Oh dear, I always get them mixed up... anyway, it looked like dry skin, but this is different. This silver stuff, it looks like dust... or maybe it's just age spots?""","I'm gettin' all...all these things on my skin. It looks like silver dust, ya know? Just a fine powder, like someone sprinkled somethin' on me. I was out in the garden yesterday, and I thought maybe it was just some sorta plant dander or somethin', but...no, no...it's not that. And then there's this peelin' on my arms. My back too. It's like my skin is slippin' off, like a snake sheddin' its skin! (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, the dust. It's all over me, even in my hair. I feel it when I comb it out. Silver flakes, just like...just like the ones my grandma used to make ornaments with. (chuckles) She'd heat 'em up and shape 'em into little animals... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, this dustin' on my skin! It's gettin' worse, I can feel it. And that peelin'...it's itchier now than ever. I've been puttin' cream on it, but it don't seem to help nothin'. (pauses again) You know what? I had a sister, her name was Margaret...or was it Martha? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up! Anyway, she used to have skin problems, and we'd go see this doctor in the city...what's his name now? Dr. Smith? No, no, that's not right... (trails off)

Anyway, I'm worried sick about this, Doc. It just feels so...unusual. I don't know what's causin' it or if it's some kinda disease or whatnot. Can you have a look at me and tell me what's goin' on?"

I'm also experiencing skin flaking.","Here's my skin rash, doc... or is it your sister, Edna? Wait, no... Anyway, this red stuff on my body, it started on my arm, but now it's all over – chest, belly, everywhere! It's so itchy, I swear, it drives me crazy. Especially at night, I'd say around 10 o'clock, yes, 10... or is that when the news comes on? Ugh, this rash! And have you ever tried to sleep with one of these things? No rest for the wicked! Oh, and now my skin's all flaking off like crazy. It's a right nuisance, I tell ya.","I think I've been gettin' this rash on my arms for a while now... yeah, months maybe? And at first, it was just little spots, but now it's spreadin' everywhere! Even got some on my chest and belly, you see... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put that picture of my grandkids? Ah yes, the rash. So, like I was sayin', it's all red and bumpy and itchy. Irritatin' is what it is. Keeps me up at night, too. Can't sleep thinkin' about those blisters... (chuckles to herself)

Nighttime, you see, that's when it really acts up. Must be somethin' with the heat or the blankets... no, wait, I had a rash like this before. Wasn't it during one of them camping trips? (pauses, lost in thought) Oh dearie me...

Skin flakin', too. That's what my sister-in-law called it when I told her about it last week. She said to try some of that Vaseline stuff... (mumbles under her breath) didn't work last time, though... Flakes everywhere! And they're so dry and papery... Can hardly wear me favorite scarf no more. (laughs)

Now, what was the question again? Oh yes, the rash. It's just gettin' worse and worse. Hope you can do somethin' about it. Been takin' these antihistamines my doctor prescribed, but they don't seem to be helpin'. (looks around the room) Where did I put that little box of... uh..."

I am also facing joint pain.","""Uh, you know, my skin rash... (pauses) Oh, I was just thinkin' about that time I saw a movie with Paul Newman... anyway. It gets worse in the winter, when it's dry out. Can't blame me for feelin' like the Sahara desert, if you know what I mean! (chuckles) Air's so dry, my skin just cries out for some help. So I put on this cream, and then that one... can't even remember their names no more. Oh, it starts with a 'C', or was it a 'D'? (laughs) Ah, anyway, that helps. And humidifiers, of course. Help keep the moisture in, you see.

""Now, where was I? Ah yes! Joint pain. Been gettin' worse too... (pauses, searching for words) Like my bones are creakin', just like this old house I used to live in... But, uh, it's not just that.

(chuckles) I told her I was just gettin' older, but really... (sighs)

Anyway, my doctor – that nice young man, Dr. Smith – he said it's probably dry skin, so I started usin' those rich moisturizers and whatnot. And you know what? It helps a bit! But then I have to do it every day, twice even... (pauses) Did I tell you about my cat, Mittens? She loves to curl up on my lap when I'm applyin' cream. (laughs softly)

Oh, right! My skin! So, with the dry air and all, I also got these humidifiers goin', as Dr. Smith said. They're quite nice, actually... (gets distracted) Wait, what was I sippin' on today? Ah yes, tea! Nice cup of tea... anyway...

Now, another thing – my joints, dear me... they ache somethin' fierce! Especially after shovelin' snow or doin' the dishes. My hands are always a bit stiff, like I've got arthritis or something... (mumbles to herself) I could swear I saw Dr. Johnson about this once..."

Uh, where was I? Ah yes! The rash. It's on my arms, legs, and back. And if you look at my nails... (holds up hands) You'll see all them little dents. Been getting those for months now. And don't even get me started on the skin peeling... (starts to ramble) My grandmother used to make these wonderful cookies, peach cobbler... (stops herself) Oh dear, I'm digressing...

It's keeping me up at night...","I've been havin' trouble sleepin', doc... can't seem to get a wink... all this itchiness... and pain from this rash... oh boy, I got so many things on my mind.

Anyway, this rash... it started a few weeks ago, I think... or was it last month? (chuckles) Oh dear, gettin' old is like tryin' to keep track of your socks. It's on my arms, legs... and these little bumps are all over me. I've been puttin' cream on 'em, but nothin's workin'. And the pain! Shoot, it hurts somethin' awful when I scratch.

Now, you ask about my nails? (pauses) Oh, yeah... they're all dented up. My daughter said maybe I'm gettin' some kind of nail disease or somethin'. I don't know what that is... but I'm worried. And then there's this peelin', like flakin' off skin... on my hands, feet, even my face a little bit... (stops) You know what? I swear I had a similar rash when I was a teenager, out playin' in the woods all day... (chuckles to self) Must've been a different kind of sunburn...

My mind's racin', doc. So much on my plate lately... the grandkids comin' over tomorrow, need to get some dinner ready... can't remember if I turned off the stove... anyway, back to this rash... it's drivin' me crazy! (sighs)"

(chuckles nervously) On my knees, elbows, arms... everywhere, really.

And it hurts. Oh boy, it hurts something awful. Like someone's taken a match to it and lit it on fire. Burning sensation, that's what I'd call it. Not just warm, no, like a flame. But I've been doing okay with the medication for my arthritis... (trails off)

Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. And these dents... in my nails! You see 'em? Little divots, right there. (tries to show doctor) It's like they're growing little hills and valleys on their own. Worrisome business, that. Don't know if it's connected to the peeling or not, but... (pauses again)

Excuse me for a sec... (coughs) My joints, they're actin' up somethin' fierce. Pain like I've never known before. Even just gettin' out of bed in the mornin' is agony now. And my skin, good Lord above... it's all... silvery-like. You know what I mean? Like them new-fangled powders they use at the beauty parlor. (pauses) Elbows and back, mostly.

Now, let me think on this for a sec... (taps hand on armrest) I swear, my grandmother had it too. Or was it her sister? Ah, yes! The powder thingy! She used to put it in her hair, not on her skin, of course. (chuckles) Oh dearie, I'm gettin' all confused now...

Where was I? Ah yes, the dented nails and joint pain. Must've been after that nasty cold I had last year... or maybe it's just my age catchin' up with me? (sighs) All these medicines they give me, don't seem to be helpin' much, if you ask me... (mumbles under breath)"

(sighs) Sorry, doc, my mind's just all over the place today...","I don't know if I should've had that big ol' turkey dinner last week, might've been a little too much... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! So, breathin' is gettin' to be a real problem. Can't catch my breath after walkin' across the room. It's like tryin' to breathe through a straw or somethin'. And then there's this nausea... (pauses again) You know, I had that once before... when was it? Oh dear, can't recall. My cousin Edna had some stomach trouble, something about gas... no, wait, that's not it. (chuckles)

Anyway, belly pain. Mild, like you said. Not too bad, but still. It's there all the time. Can be a bit uncomfortable at night when I'm tryin' to sleep. And these dizziness spells? Scary stuff! I thought I was gonna pass out just the other day... or was it last week? Time gets away from ya, don't it?

(pauses, looks around) Now, where's my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table. Oh dearie me... (stares off into space)

Back to what I was sayin', doctor's visit and all that. Yes, these symptoms have been goin' on for a while now. And like I said, it gets pretty terrifying at times. Can't really breathe, feel like I'm gonna be sick all the time... (pauses once more) You know, my aunt Edna had high blood pressure... or was that low?"
109,Typhoid,"Diarrhea has been really watery and foul-smelling, and it's been accompanied by abdominal pain. I feel like vomiting most of the time.","Doc, you see... I've been having these... uh, loose stools. Real watery, and they smell terrible, if you know what I mean. Makes me feel like I need to... (pauses) Oh, I was just at the market yesterday, got some lovely fresh tomatoes. Reminds me of when your mother used to make that salad for me... anyway... so these stools have been coming out nonstop. And it's accompanied by this... ache in my belly. Abdominal pain, that's what you young folks call it, I think? (chuckles) Time flies, don't it? Feels like just yesterday I was having those... (pauses again) Ah yes! The pain. It's a dull ache, mostly in the lower left side. And then there's this... queasiness. Like I'm about to... you know... upchuck all day long.","I'm not sure if it's my stomach or something else, but... (pauses) excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, my belly's been aching somethin' fierce lately. It feels like... (hesitates) you know when you get that crampy feeling in your gut, and then it just goes away? No, no, this is different. This is... (trails off)

Oh dear, I remember now! The doctor's been tellin' me about this one patient who had a similar problem. They said somethin' about food poisoning, but I'm not sure if that's right... (sighs) Anyway, my diarrhea's been real bad. It's like water, just flows right outta me. And the smell! Lord have mercy, it's like nothin' I've ever smelled before. (pauses, distracted) Did I tell you about my grandkid's birthday party last week? They had a big ol' cake... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, diarrhea. So, it's been comin' out real fast, and I feel like I'm gonna... (hesitates again) you know how sometimes you feel queasy in the mornin'? Like your stomach's turnin' somersaults or somethin'? Yeah, that's what I've been feelin' most of the time. And this pain... it's like someone's stuck a knife right through my belly and won't let go! (gulps)

I think I might've eaten some spoiled meat last week... no, wait, was it the week before? (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all jumbled up. Anyway, like I said, the diarrhea's been real bad, and this pain... it's just been killin' me. I feel like I'm gonna throw up every minute... (trails off, lost in thought)"

(coughs) I'm so sorry about this, but I've been havin' trouble sleepin'. Fever's just killed me, ya know? High fever, day and night, every day... or is it every other day? (pauses) Oh dear, I don't know. And the headache, Lord have mercy... it's like someone's taken a hammer to my head. Chills too, all the time. (clears throat) My granddaughter told me about her cat havin' chills last week... anyway...

And then there's this pain in my belly area... or is it my stomach? (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up. Terrible pain, doc. Every morning, right after breakfast... or was it dinner? Hmm... (pauses again) Ah, yes! Pain in the belly area. Woke me up like a shot this mornin', poor thing.","Oh dearie me... I'm having such a hard time sleeping lately, you know? Fever's been going up and down like my granddaughter's favorite TV show, ""Days of Our Lives"". (pauses) I mean, what was that other one I liked to watch? Oh yes, ""The Price is Right""... or was it ""I Love Lucy""? Never mind. Anyway, this fever, it just won't quit. And the headache, oh my goodness... feels like someone's hammering away in there with a big ol' sledgehammer. (chuckles) Just like that time I tried to fix the roof by myself and... (trails off)

Anyway, chills, yes, that's right. Chills all day long. And then, you know what happens when I wake up? Terrible pain in my belly area. Stomach, it is. (pauses) You know, my sister used to get stomachaches too... or was it her sister-in-law? Never mind, that's beside the point. Point is, this pain in my stomach, it's just awful. Like someone's taken a big ol' knot and tied it up tight right there in the middle of me. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time... no, never mind.

(Stares off into space) Fever, headache, chills... that's what I've been having. And the pain, oh dearie me... just thinking about it gives me a crick in my neck. (coughs) Excuse me... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, sleep. Can't get any good sleep with all this going on. Just lying there, tossing and turning like a... well, you know what they say: ""like a leaf in the wind"". (laughs softly)"
111,Typhoid,"I've also been experiencing some diarrhea and constipation, which has been really worrying. It feels like a sharp, stabbing pain in my belly area. I feel tired all the time.","Now, let me tell you... this diarrhea and constipation business... it's been going on for weeks now, I think? Or was it months? Oh dear, my mind's a muddle sometimes... My cousin Edna had that trouble too, you know. She swears by those fiber supplements. But I don't know if I should be taking those or not... Doctor says... um, what's his name again? Dr. Smith? Yeah, he said to keep track of when it happens. Anyway... this pain in my belly feels like a knife stabbing me every time I eat... even water hurts sometimes. I'm just so tired all the time... and dizzy too. Always getting lightheaded when I get up from the couch.","I don't know if this is related... I've been getting these, uh, bowel movements that are either too loose or too tight, you see what I mean? It's like my body can't make up its mind! (pauses) Now, where was I going with this? Ah yes, the constipation and diarrhea. It's all been a bit of a worry, if you ask me.

Now, about that pain in my belly... it feels like someone's stabbing me with a knife every time I, uh, go to the bathroom. (pauses) Did I mention I saw my granddaughter's new puppy yesterday? Oh, it was just the cutest thing! Named him Bingo, by the way... anyway...

This sharp, stabbing pain, it's been going on for weeks now. I've tried to ignore it, but you can't ignore a knife in your side, no sir! (chuckles) My doctor said I should try some fiber supplements, but I'm not sure if that'll help with the tiredness.

I feel like I'm running on fumes all the time, just going through the motions. Can't even remember where I put my keys this morning... (laughs) Oh dear, it's getting worse! Excuse me, what was the question again? Ah yes, the symptoms...

Now, let me see if I can think straight for a moment... (pauses) The constipation and diarrhea, sharp pain in my belly... (trails off) What was I saying about that doctor appointment last week?"
112,Typhoid,"I have had some constipation and belly pain, which has been really uncomfortable. The pain has been getting worse and it's really affecting my daily life.","Doc, I've had some trouble with my bowels, you know? Constipation, that's what the nurse called it. Belly pain, too. It's been gettin' worse, really uncomfortable. I mean, I was at the market yesterday and saw this young whippersnapper, couldn't be more than 20 years old... Anyway, the pain, it's been gettin' worse. I was thinkin', maybe it's from that time I ate them beans? No, wait, was that last week or two weeks ago? Oh dear, my mind's a blank slate sometimes... Ah yes, anyway... It's really affectin' my daily life. Can't even sit through a movie without gettin' up to use the restroom...","I don't know if I should be tellin' you this, but... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! Constipation and belly pain. It's been a right nuisance, if I'm honest with you. Can't remember when it started exactly... must've been after that time I had the chicken soup for lunch? (chuckles)

Now, let me get on with it. The constipation, well, I'd say it's about three, four days since my last... umm, movement. Yeah, that's what I call it. Movement. (pauses again) You know, when you go to the bathroom and... (trails off)

Anyway, the belly pain. It's been gettin' worse, if you ask me. Used to be just a twinge here and there, but now it's like someone's punchin' me in the gut. And it's always at night! Can't sleep with this ache, no sir. (sighs) I tried some of that Beano stuff, but it didn't seem to do much good.

Daily life, you say? (chuckles nervously) Well, let's just say I'm not as spry as I used to be. Hard to keep up with the grandkids when your belly's protestin' every step. (pauses once more) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! My wife says she's noticed it too... or is that my sister? No, wait, it's my daughter... or is it? (laughs awkwardly) Oh dearie me...

Oh, and the pain! It's like a burnin' sensation. Right under my ribcage. I'm not sure if it's related to the constipation or just... (sighs) You know how sometimes your body just decides to act up? Yeah, that's what this feels like.

Now, where did I put those reading glasses?"
113,Typhoid,"I am experiencing a lot of belly pain and constipation, which has been really annoying. Sometimes, I feel a strong urge to vomit, and because of all of these, I am feeling very weak.","I'm havin' this awful belly pain... been goin' on for weeks now, I think. Constipation's the worst part, dearie me... haven't had a bowel movement in days, maybe longer... (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I was at my sister Edna's house and her cat got stuck in the toilet... Anyway... (pauses) Oh, yes! The pain. It's this sharp crampy thing, you know? And then sometimes it feels like my stomach's gonna turn upside down, makes me want to run to the bathroom to throw up... (gulps) I don't know what's going on with my body these days... Used to be so regular, now... (trails off) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the weakness. Felt like I'm 90 years old again, you know? Can barely make it to the couch without gettin' winded...","I'm having a lot of trouble with my belly... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about that time I had to drive all the way out to my sister's for dinner... anyway... (coughs) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. It hurts a lot and I get these... these pains in my lower back too. Constipation has been a problem for a while now. I've tried to eat more fiber, but it just doesn't seem to be working like it used to. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I remember to turn off the stove? No, no, that was yesterday... anyway...

These... these urges to throw up are getting stronger too. Last night, for instance, I had a glass of milk and suddenly my stomach just started doing flips. (chuckles nervously) Oh dear me, it's like I'm right back in the war... or so it feels! You know what I mean? Never mind...

And with all these symptoms, I feel weak, you see. My legs get all wobbly and I just can't seem to... (pauses, looks for words) ...get my strength back up again. Must be getting on in years, I suppose... (trails off)

Where's that recipe book? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table... (mumbles to self) I had a wonderful beef stew yesterday, by the way...

Oh yes, my symptoms! So, as I was saying, belly pain and constipation have just about taken over my life. (pauses, looks up) Do you think they're related?"

(hesitates) Constipation's been a problem too, and sometimes I just gotta run to the bathroom... (pauses again) Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, constipation. And then there's this vomiting business... (gets distracted) My sister Edna used to have terrible stomach issues, always on some new medication or other... (returns to topic) But, as I was sayin', the pain and vomiting, it's got me worried sick about my health... (pauses once more) I think it started a week ago? Two weeks?

Pain comin' and goin', like a bad storm cloud. Can't sit still, can't think straight. It's been three days now? Four? Time flies when you're havin' trouble. (pauses) Did I mention I saw my grandson yesterday? Such a sweet boy... Reminds me of his grandfather, God rest his soul.

Anyway, this pain in my stomach... it's been makin' me feel like I'm goin' to throw up every five minutes. And when I do, nothin' comes out. That's just not right, is it? (trails off) I used to make the best chicken soup when my husband was ill... He'd drink that whole pot and still be actin' up. (chuckles)

Constipation's been a problem too. Can't go, won't go... You know what they say about regularity, don't you? My mother always said it was good for the constitution... I think that's what she called it. Anyway, my abdomen... *coughs* Excuse me... It's all tight and sore. Must be a sign of somethin', but what? (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time I went on that cruise to the Caribbean? Beautiful beaches... I think I might've eaten some bad shrimp, though. (laughs nervously)

You see, doctor's been tellin' me about my blood pressure... *gets distracted* Oh dear, what was it we were talkin' about again? Ah yes, this pain! It's makin' me worry somethin' fierce. What if it's serious? What if I've got some sort of disease? (starts to ramble) I swear, these days everything is a disease... Last week I read about one that gives you wrinkles just by walkin' outside on a sunny day! Can't trust the news no more..."

Anyway, it's like there's a big ol' balloon in my belly and it's just... full of pressure, you know? And pain, too. It's hard to describe, but it feels like my stomach is trying to push something out, but nothing comes out.

Lord have mercy, the pressure in there... feels like a big ol' balloon ready to pop. (chuckles) Like when my grandson had one of those balloons at his birthday party...

Anyway, as I was saying, it's been quite uncomfortable. I wake up in the middle of the night, and it hurts so much. Feels like someone's pressing down on me. And then there's this... this... (struggling to find the word) ...this rumbling noise inside me. Sounds like thunderstorms in here! (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting ahead of myself...

Now, let me see if I can remember when it started... Hmm... was it after that big meal at my sister's house? Or maybe it was after that new medication the doctor gave me last year? (pauses, looks confused) Wait, what was that medicine for again? Ah yes, my blood pressure. I'm sure it has nothing to do with this... (trails off)

Oh, I know! It's probably just those beans I had at dinner. Beans can be so... so... (laughs) Well, you know how they are. But seriously, doc, what can we do about this? Can't take any more of these... these... (struggling to describe) ...these pressure waves, if you will."

We had us a big ol' picnic, and I ate too much corn on the cob... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! Belly pain. It's been goin' on for days now. Can't sleep at night 'cause of it.

And then there's these fevers... severe, like. Chills, headaches... (stammers) What's that word I'm thinkin' of? You know, the one where you get all hot and sweaty? Uh-oh, forgot already! Anyway, it's been every night for a couple weeks now. Last couple days, specifically... (hesitates) Uncomfortable is the best way to put it.

Now, let me see if I can remember my medication list... (rummages through bag) Oh dear, where did I put that? Ah, here we are! Got my blood pressure meds, but what else... (trails off) Hmm...

Strong black coffee with a splash of cream... (trails off)

Belly pains, that's what's got me worried. Stomach cramps, they come and go. It's like my insides are all twisted up inside me. Can't eat because it hurts too much. And the nausea...

I don't know if you'll remember me, but my name's Edna... I think? (pauses) Anyway, stomach pain and constipation, that's what I'm dealin' with now. It started... um... when was it again? The last few days, yes, it's been real painful. Every night, I get these headaches and chills. Can't sleep at all. Reminds me of the time my sister Ethel had those same symptoms... or was it my cousin Edna? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get 'em mixed up!

Anyway, the stomach pain, it's like a knife stabbin' through me. And constipation, well, you know how that is. Can't even go to the bathroom right. I've been eatin'... uh... (pauses to think) what was it again? Oh yes! My granddaughter said this tea would help with stomach issues, so I've been drinkin' that every day.","(Background noise of static TV in the background)

Oh dear, doc... I'm havin' some trouble with my stomach, ya see... (pauses) Now where did I put that paper? Ah yes... I was sayin', it hurts somethin' fierce. Constipated, if you know what I mean. (chuckles) Not like when I was younger, goin' to the bathroom every five minutes. Nowadays, it's a regular struggle.

(Background noise of car driving by outside)

Severe stomach pain... that's the word, isn't it? Severe. Every night, without fail, I get this headache and chills. (pauses) Now what was I cookin' for dinner last night? Ah yes, beef stew... or was it chicken soup? Anyway... (laughs) My mind's gone blank again.

(Background noise of a clock ticking)

These headaches, they come outta nowhere... one o'clock, two o'clock at night. Wake me right up, I do. (pauses) Now I remember! I went to the movies with my wife, Edna, last week. Saw that new picture with Tom Hanks... (trails off) What was it called again? Oh yes...

(Background noise of a neighbor's dog barking)

Painful days, doc... the last few days have been particularly... (pauses) I don't know how to put it. It feels like someone's pinchin' my insides somethin' fierce. Constipation's not just a little thing for me; no sirree... that's all I can say about that.

(Background noise of TV static increases)

Oh, one more thing! My back's been actin' up too. (pauses) When was the last time I saw you, anyway? Was it last week or two weeks ago? Never mind, never mind...

(Suddenly returns to original topic)
Severe stomach pain and constipation... that's what I'm tellin' ya!"
122,Typhoid,There is a distinct pain in my abdominal part. I am not sure what it is. I am also going through constant vomiting and feel nauseous.,"""Uh, doc, I've got this...abdominal pain, ya know? Been botherin' me for a bit now. Don't rightly know what it is, though. (pauses) Oh, I remember now, I had that fancy meal at the diner last week, you know, the one with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes...mashed potatoes, yeah...anyway...(chuckles) That might've been when it started, or maybe it was before that? (sighs) Ah, I'm gettin' old, can't keep track no more! (laughs nervously)

Oh, and then there's this vomiting business. Constant, day and night. Makes me feel right queasy. Can't even...can't even eat a sandwich without...you know...happening again. (pauses) Oh, speaking of sandwiches, I had the most wonderful egg salad at my granddaughter's birthday party last weekend...such a lovely girl... anyway...(stammers) Where was I? Ah yes, the pain and the vomiting. Like I said, it's been goin' on for...for...well, you know what I mean, doc...""","I'm so sorry to bother you, Doctor... (pauses) You know, I was just thinkin' about my garden this morning, and how the tomatoes are finally startin' to grow. (chuckles) And then I remembered I forgot to water 'em yesterday. (sighs)

Anyway, like I said, I got a pain in my... uh, belly part. Yes, that's it. Abdominal part. (pauses) I don't know what it is, but it hurts somethin' fierce. Like when I was younger and used to ride horses, I'd get these cramps in my lower back after a long ride... (trails off)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the pain! It's been goin' on for days now. And then there's this... vomitin', I think it's called. (pauses) Constantly feelin' like I'm gonna barf all day long. Nauseous, that's the word. My stomach's always churnin' and roarin', like a big ol' machine in here. (taps belly)

Now, let me see if I can think straight for a minute... (pauses) We were at the church picnic last weekend, and I had a sandwich with... what was it? Turkey? No, that wasn't it... (sighs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused. Ah yes! The pain! It's sharp pains, Doctor. Sharp as a knife. (pauses) Or like when my sister... wait, where did my sister go again? (laughs nervously)

Vomiting, yes, and that's just about every hour now. I'm gettin' so tired of feelin' sick all the time... (sighs) I wish I could remember what I ate for breakfast this mornin', but it's just a jumble in my head..."
123,Typhoid,"The diarrhea has been quite fluid and smelly, and it has been accompanied by severe abdominal pain and headache. Most of the time, I feel like vomiting.","Doc... or is it Dr. Johnson? Anyway... (chuckles) I've been having this diarrhea now for a week, maybe more. It's real fluid, you know? And oh boy, it smells like something died in there! (pauses to think) Abdominal pain, yeah, that's the word. Severe, doc. Like someone's stabbing me with a hot knife every hour on the... (pauses again) clock face, I guess. Headache too. Terrible headache. Makes my eyes water like when I'm watching those onions being chopped up for the stew at church... (gets distracted) You know, they should really have some ventilation in that kitchen! Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, vomiting. Most of the time, doc, it's like my stomach's trying to turn itself inside out. Makes me feel queasy just thinking about food.","I don't know if this is related... but my cousin Edna used to have these awful stomach issues, always said something about gas... anyway... the diarrhea I've been having... you see... (pauses) it's like a faucet that won't turn off! Fluids everywhere... and of course, it smells terrible. My husband says it's like the bathroom in one of them new-fangled cruise ships... (chuckles) Not funny, really.

And then there's this pain. Oh dear lord, this pain. Severe, I'd say. Abdominal, they call it? Like my belly's gone all tight and sore at the same time. And headaches! Don't even get me started on those. Feel like my head's going to... (pauses) you know what it feels like? When you're trying to take a big breath, but your lungs won't cooperate? That. Just more so.

Now and then I feel this... this urge to vomit. Yes, that's the word! Vomit. Terrible feeling, really. But then... oh dear me... sometimes I forget what I was saying or thinking about in the first place. (laughs) Must be my age showing. Anyway, would you say these symptoms might have something to do with this... this stomach flu? Or maybe food poisoning from that restaurant we went to last week?"
124,Typhoid,"I have had a fever for the last couple of days. Now, I am starting to experience a severe pain in my stomach area and suffering from constipation.","""Doc, I've had this fever for... um... two days now? Or is it three? Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, the fever. Anyway, my stomach's been aching something awful. Like a knife stab, ya know? And don't even get me started on my bowel movements. Constipated as a clamshell! (laughs) I swear, Edna from down the street has more regularity than I do. Speaks of Edna... did I tell you about her cat, Mr. Whiskers? He's quite the charmer, that one... Oh, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach pain. It started a couple days ago, maybe three? And this fever just won't quit. Ugh, excuse me, mind's gettin' all muddled... (pauses) ""","I don't know if I should be worried about this fever... been having it for two days now. Can't remember what day of the week it is, though. *pauses* Oh dearie me, where was I? Ah yes, the fever. So, I've been feeling a bit... (stares off) Wait, did I water my plants today? No, no, I'm sure they're fine... 

Anyway, this fever's got me all... (sighs) what was I saying? Oh right! It's been keeping me up at night. I swear, I've had a temperature for the past two days now. Must be one of them colds or something. *pauses* You know, I used to get sick more often when I lived in... (stops suddenly) What was that place called again? The lake house? No, no, it was somewhere else...

Oh dear! Focus! (gulps) My stomach's been acting up terribly now. Severe pain, I'd say. And this constipation business is getting rather uncomfortable. I mean, when did I last go to the bathroom properly? *thinks for a moment* Wasn't it just yesterday morning? No... (chuckles nervously) Oh dear me, I'm such an old fool sometimes...

Fever's still there, though. Can feel my temperature rising now and then. Maybe I should take some of that aspirin or... (pauses again) Wait, what was the name of that new doctor in town? The one who helped Mrs. Johnson with her back? *starts rambling*"
125,Typhoid,"I am experiencing a lot of nausea and vomiting, and it's been quite difficult for me to eat anything. I've entirely lost my appetite, and as a result, I have become quite weak.","You know, Doc... or is it Dr. Smith? I always get those two mixed up. Anyway, I've been feelin' terrible lately. This nausea and vomiting business, it's just been a real nuisance. Can't eat nothin', not even my favorite chicken soup. Don't like the taste of anything right now. (pauses) You know, I used to love chicken soup. Reminds me of when I was a kid... My grandma would make it for me when I had a cold. (chuckles) Good times...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, nausea and vomiting. It's been goin' on for... um... two weeks now? Maybe three? Time flies when you're feelin' poorly, don't it? (laughs weakly) And I'm just so tired all the time. Weak as a kitten. Can barely get out of bed in the mornin'. Just can't seem to catch my breath, either...","I'm so... so sorry doc, but lately I've been feeling just awful. You see, my stomach's been doin' flips all day long. Nausea and vomiting, that's what it is. Can't eat nothin', can't keep nothin' down. (pauses) Did you know I used to have the best garden in the neighborhood? Tomatoes, carrots, beans... (trails off)

Oh, right, my stomach. It's been like this for weeks now. Doc says it might be nerves or something, but I don't feel so nervous. Maybe it's just old age catchin' up with me. (chuckles) My grandkids always say I'm too young to be gettin' old... (laughs)

Anyway, my appetite's gone completely. Can barely think about food without gettin' queasy. Been tryin' to eat small meals, but nothin's workin'. Feel like a bag of bones, if you know what I mean. Weak all over, can't even make it to the kitchen without restin' for a bit... (stammers) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, the doctor said somethin' about electrolytes bein' off? I don't rightly understand what that means..."

I'm tellin' ya, I just can't sleep no more. This fever's been ragin' on for days now, and my head, oh boy, it's like someone's poundin' a drum in there. And then there's this belly pain... (pauses) You know, reminds me of that time I had the flu when I was workin' at the factory. (chuckles) Good Lord, I thought I was gonna be bedridden for weeks! Anyway...(trails off)

I'm gettin' a bit mixed up on dates, but it feels like... (hesitates) three days ago? Was it Tuesday or Wednesday I started feelin' this way? Ah, who knows? (laughs) My brain's as foggy as my memory!

This belly pain is just killin' me. Can't even think about goin' to the office, let alone do any work... (mutters to self) what was I s'posed to be doin' today...?""","I'm havin' some trouble sleepin', ya know? Got a fever, high one, like... hundred four or five, I think. Or was it six? No matter, I don't feel right. Headaches, you see, they come and go, like my cat Mr. Whiskers, he's gettin' up there in years too... (pauses) Oh, right! The fever.

Now, about this belly pain... (hesitates) Well, it started after that roast beef dinner I had last week, or was it the one before? You know, at my grandkids' house. Anyway, now I got cramps and I just can't get a wink of sleep. Can't go to work neither, no sirree. Can't even... (trails off) Oh, what's that song, you know the one about the sun shinin' bright? No, not that one... (sighs)

Oh dear, my stomach hurts somethin' fierce! Must've been something I ate, but I don't remember eatin' anything bad. Unless it was those beans... no, no, I'm sure it wasn't them. (chuckles) Oh boy, I'm all confused now. Fever and belly pain, that's what I got. Can't even think straight no more... (trails off)

Anyway, you see, Doc... or is it Nurse? (laughs) No matter! My fever's high, my head hurts, and I just wanna go back to bed. But I gotta tell ya, them headaches are like a drum in my head. Bangin' away... (pauses, confused) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?"
127,Typhoid,"I have been feeling really fatigued and weak, and I can't seem to get rid of it. I have a mild fever and a strange pain in my abdominal area. I can't understand what is happening.","You know, doc... or is it nurse? Anyway, I've been feelin' just... (pauses) ...dead, ya know? Fatigued and weak, like I've been runnin' a marathon or somethin'. Can't seem to shake this fatigue off no matter what I do. Then there's the fever, mild, but it's been hangin' around for... (hesitates) ...weeks now, maybe months? Time gets mixed up when you're gettin' old like me. And this pain in my belly, it's like a pinchin', sharp pinch. Can't rightly describe it. Reminds me of the time I had appendicitis back in '62. We didn't have these new-fangled medicines then... (trails off)","I don't know what's goin' on with me lately... Can't get nothin' done, feel like a sack of potatoes. Fatigue, that's what I got. Weak as a kitten too... (pauses) You know, I used to be able to mow the lawn in one day, now it takes me two days just to walk around the block... (trails off)

Mild fever, I think... No, wait, is it high? Never mind, what's important is this belly pain. (pauses, collecting thoughts) Strange pain, like someone's tuggin' on my insides. Can't rightly explain it... (hesitates) Now where did I put that aspirin? Wasn't it right here on the counter?

( muttering to self ) Must've taken it already, can't remember... Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes, this pain. It's not just in one spot, no sirree. All over, like my gut's got a knot in it... (chuckles) Knot, get it? Like a rope... Oh boy, I'm all mixed up today.

( returns to the conversation ) Now, about that fatigue... Used to be able to play with the grandkids without gettin' winded. Nowadays, just lookin' at 'em wear me out. (pauses again) Wait, what was our last appointment for? Did we schedule a new prescription or somethin'?"
128,Typhoid,"I've been suffering from constipation and stomach discomfort, which has been really uncomfortable. Last night, I had a mild fever too.","Mmm, doc... constipation, yeah... been goin' on for weeks now, I think. (pauses) Oh boy, that casserole my sister-in-law brought over last week... still got some in the fridge, don't know how long it'll keep.

(pauses again) Shoot, time just flies by when you're gettin' older! 

Mild fever, that's what I'd say. Around 99 degrees, maybe a little more. Don't rightly remember the exact temperature... wasn't too concerned 'bout it, though. Just a little chills and some fatigue, but now my stomach... (sighs) Well, you know how it is when your gut don't feel right?","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, Doctor... been having some... troubles, ya see... *pauses* Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my tummy... it's just been actin' up somethin' fierce. Constipation's been a problem for weeks now, and the stomach discomfort... *hesitates* Oh dearie me, it's like someone's playin' a trombone in there! *chuckles nervously* Sorry about that, got a bit carried away...

Anyway, as I was sayin', this constipation... and I'm not sure if it's related, but my stomach's been feelin' all... achy. Like when you've eaten too much of them beans or somethin'. *pauses to think* Oh, speaking of beans! I had the most wonderful chili at the church potluck last week... *trails off*

Oh yes, back to me... so last night, I woke up with a bit of a fever. Mild, not too bad, but still... *mutter mutter* I'm gettin' all sorts of things mixed up these days... what was that movie I saw? Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue... Ah yes! That one where... *stops self* Never mind.

I just can't seem to... focus. *laughs nervously* Sorry about this, Doctor. Where was I? Ah yes, fever! It went away in the mornin', but I'm still feelin' a bit... off. Like my body's all... out of sync or somethin'. *sighs*

Now, where did I put that piece of paper with my schedule on it...? *rummages through bag*"
129,Typhoid,"I've also been suffering from diarrhea, which has been really uncomfortable. It comes and goes, and it's accompanied by stomach aches and vomiting.","You know, doc... I've been having the most terrible time with my... uh, digestive system, if you will. (pauses) Reminds me of that time my cousin Edna had the flu, poor thing, couldn't keep nothing down for days on end... anyway...(clears throat)

I've been gettin' these, ahem, loose stools, I suppose you'd call 'em. Really uncomfortable, doc. Comes and goes, sometimes it's like clockwork, other times it just seems to... (shrugs) well, you know how it is.

Stomach aches, too. Real painful ones. And then there's the vomiting. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those fancy-pants folks who always knows exactly what's happenin' in their body, but this feels like more than just a little indigestion...(chuckles) Oh, and speaking of indigestion... did I ever tell you about that time I had that wonderful chicken parmesan at Joe's Diner? (pauses again)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the vomiting. It comes with the diarrhea, usually in the mornin' or afternoons... or is it the other way around? (laughs) Oh well, details, right?","I... I don't know if this is relevant, but I had a nice piece of pie for dessert yesterday at the church potluck. It was a rhubarb pie, and it was just so good... (pauses) Oh, yes! The diarrhea. Well, it's been coming and going, like my Aunt Edna used to say about her migraines. (chuckles) I don't know if that makes sense, but you know what I mean.

Anyway, it's been quite uncomfortable, I'll tell you what. Stomach aches, vomiting... all that jazz. (pauses again) Did I already mention the pie? No, no, let me start again. So, the diarrhea... yeah, it comes and goes like my mood swings in the spring when the pollen's bad. And then there are these stomach aches... (hesitates) Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes! Stomach aches. Like someone's got their fist inside me, twisting my insides. Vomiting too... not just once or twice, but every hour on the hour, it feels like.

And the thing is, I don't know if it's related to anything else going on in my life. My husband says I'm just eating too much fiber... (pauses) Fiber! You know, back when I was working at the factory, we used to get those little packets of sugar-free gum for our lunchboxes. It had that aspartame stuff in it... maybe that's what caused all these problems? No, no, let me focus here. Diarrhea, stomach aches, vomiting... that's my complaint, I think. (pauses once more) Oh dear!"

I've been feelin' so poorly lately. Chills, fever, and my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Can't get a good night's sleep, and I just feel like I'm stuck in the mud. You know, remind me of that time I went to my sister Edna's... no, not Edna, it was Mabel's house for dinner last week? Last week or was it... uh, anyway... I digress.

These symptoms have been goin' on for... hmm, let me see... must be three days now. Or is it four? Doesn't matter, really. The point is, I'm miserable. My belly hurts somethin' awful, and I just want to crawl back into bed.","I don't know if this is just old age gettin' me down, but I've been feelin' pretty crummy lately... got these chills, ya know? And a fever, I think it was yesterday... or was it last week? Ah, bother the dates! Anyway, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Can't keep nothin' down. I mean, I had that roast chicken for dinner, and now I'm wonderin' if it was maybe... uh... bad meat? You'd think I'd remember if I had a good piece of beef or not! (chuckles) Oh dearie me...

Now, let's see... what was the question again? Ah yes, my symptoms. So, there's these chills, and then this fever that won't go away... And stomach discomfort. Ugh, it feels like someone's tryin' to rip my insides apart! I'm gettin' a bit... (pauses) where did I put my slippers? Ah yes, now I remember! Anyway, as I was sayin', this discomfort is just dreadful. It's not just the pain, it's... it's like my whole gut's gone haywire!

Now, what's that word... you know, when your body just feels all... (gestures with hands) out of sorts? That's what it is! And I'm just so tired all the time. Unhappy, too. Don't know if it's these symptoms or gettin' older, but I swear, some days are just a struggle to get through... (trails off) Wait, now where did I put that piece of paper?"

And then there's this fever. Mild, they said on the thermometer. But it feels like my whole body's on fire! (pauses) Now, where did I put those aspirins? I could swear I had some right here in this drawer... (rummages through drawer) Ah yes! Here they are. (returns to the conversation)

Stomach pain, too. Can't sit still for one minute without wincin' like a toothache. My husband says it's just gas from eatin' too much beans and cabbage... but I think it's somethin' more than that. (pauses again) You know, I had a friend at work who had the same trouble, her name was... uh... Mabel? No, no, not Mabel... Mrs. Jenkins! That's right. She ended up with some sort of infection... (trails off)

Oh dear, doctor, I'm gettin' all mixed up. Can we just focus on this tummy business for now? (clears throat) Vomiting and diarrhea, mild fever, and stomach pain. That's it! That's what I've been tellin' you all along... (laughs nervously)"

Oh dear, my mind gets foggy sometimes... Ah yes! The diarrhea started in the morning. Severe cramps and discomfort. Don't feel like eatin' nothin', can't even think about food.

I mean, I've been goin' back and forth to the bathroom, if you know what I mean. Diarrhea, yeah, that's what it is. Terrible cramps in my belly, makes me wanna double over sometimes. (pauses) You know, I remember when I was a young woman, I had some sort of...I think it was food poisoning? No, no, must've been the flu. (chuckles) My mother-in-law used to say, ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" What's that got to do with anything?

Where was I? Ah yes, belly pain! It's quite severe, doc. And I just can't seem to muster up any appetite. Usually love a good plate of chicken soup or some nice warm oatmeal...but nothin' sounds appetizin' these days.

And then there's this headache I've been gettin'. Mild, but it's like... (pauses, searching for words) ...like tryin' to think through a thick fog. Don't know what's causin' it, maybe stress? My sister's cat, Whiskers, passed away last week... (gets distracted) You know, I had that same picture on my fridge when I was a young bride...just like this one.

Anyway, I just thought I'd mention all these symptoms to you, doc. Hope you can help me figure out what's goin' on in there. (trails off)"

Oh, yes! The symptoms. So, this fever and chills every night, it's just terrible. I get all hot and sweaty, and then I'm shakin' like a leaf. My husband says it's just the flu again, but I'm not so sure... (frowns) Wasn't I supposed to have some test last week? I think Dr. Smith was going to call me... or was it Dr. Johnson?

Oh, and another thing... I've been havin' these stomach growls, like thunder inside me belly! Sounds silly, but it's quite loud, I assure you. My granddaughter loves to hear it, she laughs every time... *chuckles*

Oh yes, stomach pain. It hurts real bad, even after taking those pills you gave me. Can't eat a thing without feeling sick to my stomach. I feel like vomiting all the time now. And I just can't seem to get any strength back. My legs are all wobbly too. (pauses) What was I saying? Ah yes... weakness. That's what it is. Extremely weak. Can't even carry my own groceries no more.","I don't know if I'm getting this right, but... (pauses) Oh, wait, what was the question again? Ah yes, my stomach pain. Well, it's been going on for a week now, I think it might be more... or less, depending on how you count the days. Anyway, it started with some cramps and now it just hurts all the time. (chuckles) You know, like when you're trying to get comfortable in your favorite armchair, but it's not quite right.

I've been taking some medicine for it, I'm pretty sure that's what I've been doing... or was it my grandson who brought me a bag of pills? (laughs) Oh dear, anyway... it doesn't seem to be helping. I feel like I'm going to throw up all the time, and eating makes it worse. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing at Lake Michigan? Beautiful weather that day...

And because of this stomach business, I've been feeling extremely weak. Can barely lift my legs off the couch... (trails off) Now where did I put those reading glasses? Ah yes, now I remember... it's hard to keep track of things these days. Anyway, as I was saying... no, wait, what was I saying again? Oh dear me...

Oh, and I almost forgot! I had a dream last night about eating a big plate of spaghetti... (chuckles) That reminds me, I need to call my daughter and ask her to make some for dinner. Or maybe it's Tuesday? (pauses)"
135,Typhoid,I am having severe stomach discomfort and diarrhoea. I have a high fever along with a headache. The previous several days have been really unpleasant.,"Oh dear doctor, I'm having such a time with my stomach... uh, discomfort. Yes, that's what they call it, isn't it? *pauses* Anyway, it's been bothering me something fierce for... well, let me see... three days now, I think? No, wait, was it four? Oh dear, my memory ain't what it used to be... *chuckles*

I had a lovely lunch at the church potluck on Wednesday, you know. The ladies made the most wonderful chicken salad... *pauses* But anyway, back to my stomach. It's been crampy and sore, like someone's squeezing it tight. And then there's this diarrhoea... *hesitates* I don't rightly want to talk about that part... *coughs*

Oh dear me, I've had such a fever too. My head's been pounding something awful. I took some aspirin, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. I just feel so... under the weather. And to make matters worse, I think I might have left my reading glasses at home... or was that the living room? *laughs nervously*","I'm having... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm having such a time with my stomach. Discomfort, you know? It's like a... (hesitates) a knot in there. Can't quite describe it. Diarrhea, yes. That's the word. Been going on for days now. And this fever, high one. My temperature's been up, I'm sure of it. I had to take that thermometer out again... where did I put it? Ah yes, here it is. 102 degrees. No, no, wait, was it my sister who took her temperature once and it said 101? (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway...

Headache's been terrible too. Like someone's pounding on the side of my head with a hammer. Can't think straight when it's like that. And what was I saying about... oh yes! The past few days have been just miserable. I'm getting old, you know? My wife says I complain too much. (laughs) Well, maybe she's right. But what can I do? Time gets away from us, doesn't it?

I remember when my brother had a similar thing happen... no, wait, was it my cousin? (pauses) Oh dear, anyway... he took some of those pills, the ones that start with an M... Metamucil? No, that's not it. My niece used those once and they helped her so much. I think that's what it is... (trails off)

Fever's gone on for days now. Must be something I ate, but what was it? Ah well..."
136,Typhoid,"I am having a terrible pain in my abdominal part, and I've been feeling really nauseated. I'm also experiencing a mild fever. I am really worried.","I've been havin' this...this pain in my tummy area, dear. It's just awful. And I feel so queasy all the time. Can't even keep my coffee down no more. Nauseated, that's what it is. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the doctor for a stomach bug? (chuckles) Oh boy, I was green around the gills! Anyway... (clears throat) And then there's this fever. Not too high, just a little bit of heat, ya know? Mild, they say. But it's still here, botherin' me somethin' fierce. Now, what day is today again? I swear, it's all mixed up in my mind... (trails off)","I don't know what's goin' on with me... (pauses) Oh, where did I put my cane? Nowhere to be found, that's just great... (chuckles) Anyway, this pain in my belly... it's been gettin' worse and worse. Abdominal part, that's what they call it, right? (pauses) Nausea, that's the word. Felt queasy all day yesterday, too. And today, I woke up feelin' like... well, not exactly sick, but... (trails off)

Fever, I think. Mild fever, at least. Not sure how to measure it, though. Never was good with thermometers... (pauses) You know what's funny? I used to have a thermometer when I was a kid. It had little hands on it. One for high and one for low... (chuckles) Oh dear...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this pain. It's like a cramp or somethin', but all over my middle. Not just here (taps stomach). And the nausea... it's always there, lurkin' in the background. Makes me feel... (pauses) anxious, that's it. Really worried, to be honest with you. Don't know what to do..."
137,Typhoid,"I am experiencing constipation and stomach ache. The discomfort has gotten worse, and it is seriously interfering with my everyday life. I feel like I have lost my appetite to eat anything.","Constipation and stomach ache... been goin' on for, oh dear, I don't know how long now. It feels like weeks, maybe months? Time just gets away from ya, don't it? (pauses) You know, my cousin Edna used to get constipated somethin' fierce, and she'd always take those Beano tablets... (trails off)

Anyway, the pain's gotten worse, dear me. Can't even enjoy a nice cup of tea no more. My stomach's just in knots all the time. I try eatin', but nothin' tastes right. Feel like I've lost my appetite, completely. Even the thought of food makes me feel queasy... (pauses again) Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous chicken pot pie? I swear I left it right here on the counter...","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... oh dear, sorry about this, doc. *pauses* Ah yes, so my belly's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Constipation, that's what it is. Can't go like I used to. You know when you're gettin' old, everything slows down, right? *chuckles*

Anyway, stomach ache... it comes and goes, but it's always there, naggin' at me. Pain in the gut, feels like someone's got a fist in my side. Can't eat nothin', lost appetite entirely. Don't know why I'm thinkin' of this, but didn't we just talk about my colonoscopy results? *pauses* Oh dear, what was it again?

Oh yes, constipation! It's like... uh... *hesitates* Like a big ol' log jam in there. Can't get things movin', you know? And the stomach ache, it's this sharp pain... feels like I'm bein' stabbed in the gut. No, that's not right, it's more like... *pauses again*

Now where was I? Oh yes, can't eat nothin'. Can barely keep down my coffee, let alone a real meal. That's why I'm worried, see? Interferes with daily life... *gets sidetracked* You know, when we were kids, my sister used to make the best apple pies in the county. She was famous for 'em...

Oh dear me! Sorry about that. Got carried away there. Where was I? Ah yes, symptoms! Like I said, stomach ache and constipation, they go hand in hand... *hesitates* Or is it foot in hand? No, no, doesn't matter now. Anyway, it's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I'm just not listenin'."
138,Typhoid,"Most of the time I feel fatigued. I don't want to eat anything. I get a high fever and chills every night. Moreover, I have been vomiting since yesterday.","""Uh, doc... most of the time, I feel just plumb tuckered out, you know? Don't wanna eat nothin', not even my favorite chicken soup... (pauses) Oh, I made that for my husband, Edith's nephew, last week... anyway. High fever and chills every night, it feels like a cold wind goin' through me bones. And yesterday, well, it was Tuesday, I think? Or was it Wednesday? (chuckles) Don't matter, the point is, I've been throwin' up since... um... when was that again? (pauses) Oh dear, my memory's gettin' away from me. Ah yes, vomiting! Been doin' that since yesterday morning, I'm pretty sure.""","I don't know if this is what they call it... fatigue? Yeah, that's right, I'm always tired, even after sleeping all day. Can't seem to get a wink of sleep at night either. My granddaughter was over yesterday, and she brought her little boy, he's such a sweetie... anyway... eating just doesn't interest me no more. Don't want to cook, don't want to eat... oh dear, what was I saying? Oh yes, that.

It's like my body's just shutting down or something. High fever every night, and the chills, they're so bad. My mother used to get those too when she had her heart troubles... no wait, it was the flu, wasn't it? Anyway, it's been going on for weeks now. Vomiting's been a new one, though. Started yesterday morning, I think. Yeah, started vomiting.

You know what's funny? Yesterday, I thought I saw our old cat, Mr. Whiskers... he passed away years ago. But then again, maybe it was just the heat making me see things. Heat makes me feel all sorts of miserable. I've been taking these new supplements my sister recommended, but maybe they're not working as well as she said? And now I'm thinking about that roast chicken we had for dinner last Sunday... was it good? It wasn't very good, actually. My knees have been bothering me a lot too... I think I'll tell you about that some other time.

What were we talking about again? Oh yes, the fever and chills. They're just awful."
139,Typhoid,"I have lost my appetite and have noticed a significant weight loss. I have abdominal pain, especially in the area of my stomach and intestines. I am concerned about my health.","""Oh dearie me... doc said to come in, you see. I've been feeling just dreadful lately. Lost my appetite completely, can't seem to eat a thing. Weight's dropping off like crazy, too much if you ask me. Stomach's been killin' me, literally hurtin'. Especially down near the intestines, that's where it really throbs... Oh, I remember when my sister-in-law lost weight just like this, she said it was from stress, but then she ended up with... uh... whatever it was called... you know, that disease? And it took her ages to get back on her feet. Anyway, I'm worried sick about myself now. Must be 20 pounds since the last check-up... or is it 10? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, this pain business. Can't seem to eat a bite without feelin' like I've been punched in the gut.""","I don't know if you're the one I'm s'posed to see... Oh dear, I got all mixed up... Doctor? Was that right? Anyway... (pauses) My appetite's gone, it's just vanished like a ghost in the night. Can't seem to eat nothin'. Tried to make myself some soup yesterday, but even that didn't sound good. Used to love my chicken noodle, you know. Reminds me of when I was a young girl... (gets sidetracked) Oh dearie me, I remember making it for the neighbors after they lost their cat...

Now where was I? Ah yes, weight loss. It's been going on for months now. Don't even recognize myself in the mirror no more. (chuckles) Look like one of those old folks you see on TV... (trails off)

Abdominal pain, that's what it is... Stomach and intestines, all sorts of trouble down there. Can be real painful at times, especially after eatin' – or tryin' to eat, I should say. Makes me feel like I've been run over by a truck. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time my sister's husband had that... uh, what was it called? Oh yes, appendicitis! Poor man was in so much pain...

Concerned about my health, that's why I came here today. Want to get to the bottom of this mess, if you know what I mean. Don't want to be one of those folks who... (pauses again) You know, when they're all mixed up and can't even remember their own name! Oh dear me, no sirree..."
140,Typhoid,The stomach discomfort has been severe and frequent. Vomiting and constipation have also happened. I'm concerned about my health.,"Doc...I've been feeling quite poorly lately. Stomach discomfort, you know, severe and frequent. It's like a knot in there, won't go away. And then I start throwing up, gotta run to the bathroom every morning. Can't even hold my breakfast down no more. And, oh dear, constipation too...haven't had a bowel movement in days, I think it was...Tuesday? No, Wednesday? Anyway, can't remember exactly when...but it's been going on for weeks now. I'm getting worried about my health, doc. My sister-in-law Edna, she's always saying her husband Bob's been having similar troubles with his stomach. Don't know if that means anything, but thought I'd mention it...","Oh dear doctor... stomach... uh... discomfort, yeah that's what I've been having. Been feeling it for a while now, can't quite remember exactly how long... might have started after that big ol' plate of chili I had at the church dinner... or was it before that? Hmm... Anyway, it's been pretty bad. Severe, they call it, don't you think so too?

Frequent, that's what my granddaughter said when I told her about it. ""Grandma, it sounds like you're really suffering!"" And I am, dear me! Vomiting... (pauses) Oh look, a bird outside the window! (chuckles) Sorry, where was I? Ah yes, vomiting and constipation too. Can't recall when that started, but it's been going on for ages now.

Now what was it I wanted to tell you about my health? Uh... oh yes, this discomfort business! Severe stomach pain, like someone's stabbing me with a fork all the time. (laughs) Too much coffee, maybe? I've been drinking a lot of coffee lately, and my husband says I'm starting to sound like him when he was working on the farm. You know, always complaining about his stomach... (trails off)

Oh dear doctor, what's going on with me? Am I getting old or something? My mind's all fuzzy now. Wait, where did I put that recipe for my famous three-layer lasagna? Hmm... Anyway, like I was saying, the vomiting and constipation have been happening a lot too. Must get it checked out before it gets worse. Don't want to be stuck in the hospital with a tube down my throat or nothin'! (laughs) Oh dear me, what's gotten into me today?!"
141,Typhoid,"I have been experiencing diarrhea and have had loose, watery stools several times a day. I have lost my appetite and feel nauseated all the time. I am starting to get a mild fever too.","""Oh dearie me... diarrhea, yes, that's been goin' on for... umm, I think it started last week? Or was it the week before? Oh wait, I had that appointment with my sister, you know, Betsy or is it Betty? Anyway... loose stools, all watery and everything. Lord have mercy, I'm feelin' like a raccoon in the dumpster. Lost me appetite, too. Can't even look at food no more. Nausea's been followin' me around like a pesky little dog. And now this fever business... think it's maybe 100 degrees? I took my temperature, but I always forget what the numbers mean... anyway, I'm gettin' a bit warm in the afternoons... probably just need some tea...""","I don't know if you'd believe me, doc... I mean, this is all so confusing. Diarrhea, that's what I've been having. Loose stools, watery... (pauses) Oh dear, I remember my mother used to make these wonderful homemade applesauce jars for us kids when we were young... (trails off) Wait, what was the question again?

Ah yes, diarrhea. It started a few days ago. (pauses to think) Maybe a week? No, no, it's been more than that. (chuckles) My mind's getting old on me. Anyway, I've had these... (hesitates) loose stools, like I said. Several times a day. Can't seem to keep anything down, either. Nausea all the time. Felt like I was going to vomit just now, in fact... (gulps)

And then there's this fever business... Mild one, but it's been with me for days now. (mutters under her breath) Must remember to pick up some more aspirin at the store tomorrow...

I'm not sure what's causing all of this, but I've been eating the same things as usual – you know, oatmeal in the morning, soup for lunch... Don't think it's anything I ate. (frowns) Unless... unless it was that piece of fish I had on Tuesday? No, no, that can't be right. (sighs)

Anyway, like I said, doc... or should I say, doctor... It started with the diarrhea. Then the nausea and fever came along for the ride... (fades off) Oh, did I tell you about the time my husband's cousin got food poisoning from eating spoiled hot dogs at a picnic?"
142,Typhoid,"I am feeling quite weak. I'm having a lot of stomach discomfort and constipation, which is really bothering me. I have a strong urge to vomit at times, and as a result, I can't eat anything.","I don't know if this is what they call it, but I'm feelin' quite... weak, I suppose you'd say. Stomach discomfort, yeah, that's a good word for it. Been havin' trouble with my... uh, regularities, if you will. Can't seem to go like I used to. Constipation's got me down somethin' fierce. Can't even look at food without thinkin', ""Oh boy, here we go again."" You know, reminded me of that one time I went on a cruise and ate those... you know what they call 'em? Fried dough things with powdered sugar. Lord have mercy, my stomach's still grumblin' just thinkin' about it. Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh right, weak and stomach issues... got this... urge to be sick sometimes. Like a warnin', ""Get ready for somethin' to come up."" And then, of course, I don't eat much 'cause that's just... well, you can see where it gets me. Now what time is it, anyway?","I don't know if I should be talkin' about this... Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Weakness, you see, it's like a weight on me, ya know? Like I'm carryin' around a heavy bag all the time. And them cramps! Good grief, they're so... so... (pauses) Oh dear, what was that recipe I was thinkin' of makin'? That chicken soup with the carrots and celery... or was it the other way 'round? Never mind.

Anyway, my stomach's been feelin' like a knot in a rope. Can't keep nothin' down, ya hear me? Nausea's got me goin' around in circles. I mean, I want to eat somethin', but then... well, you know how it is when you don't wanna be sick again. Constipation's another thing altogether. (pauses) Now, what was the name of that new medication I started takin'? The one for high blood pressure? Hmm...

My constipation's gotten so bad, I'm practically livin' on... (pauses) Where did I put my tea? Ah yes! I've been drinkin' all this peppermint tea. That usually helps with the... uh... (trails off) Oh dear, sorry about that. Focus. Constipation. Yes, it's just miserable. And them stomach pains! They keep me up at night, like a naggin' little pest. Can't say I'm feelin' too well myself today..."
143,Typhoid,"There is strange pain in my stomach area. I don't know what the reason behind this is. Moreover, I am starting to get a mild fever along with chills and headaches.","You know, I woke up this morning... I think it was Wednesday? Anyway, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Got this strange pain in there, right around where the button is on my shirt. Don't rightly know what's causin' it. Maybe I ate too much of that good ol' fashioned beans 'n' bacon at the church picnic last Sunday? No, wait, was it the other way around? Never mind... (sigh)

Anyway, stomach pain and all, now I'm feelin' kinda funny. Got a mild fever, you see, and these chills are runnin' right through me like a cold wind in January. And then there's the headaches... Lord have mercy, they're gettin' worse by the minute!","Ooh, doc... sorry, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my stomach. Been hurtin' somethin' fierce lately. Don't know why, don't know how... just one of them things, you know? Like when I got that new pair of shoes and they gave me blisters on my toes. Or that time I ate too many beans and, uh, well...

Anyway... stomach's been achin', like a crampy sorta thing. Can't describe it no better than that. Maybe some gas, maybe not? Don't know what to make of it. My mom used to say, ""When your stomach hurts, take a little walk and breathe."" I did that yesterday, walked around the block, breathed in some fresh air... didn't seem to do much good.

Oh dear, my fever's been actin' up too. Mild, they said? Mild?! It feels like I'm on fire! Chills, shivers, the works. Don't know if it's related or just a separate issue... You see, I was readin' about that one disease, uh, you know, the one with the numbers and the... (taps forehead) Oh dear, what was its name? Ah yes, diabetes! Could be that, maybe.

Headaches, too. Terrible pressure in my head. Like someone's tryin' to squeeze it outta me. Must be related to the fever, I reckon. And when I eat, the pain just gets worse... or is it better? (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?"
144,Typhoid,"I've had a high fever, particularly at night. It's been quite unpleasant. There is a little headache, as well as constipation and diarrhea. I don't feel like eating anything.","Oh boy, doc... this fever, it's been quite the nuisance. Keeps me up at night, you know? Like last week... no, was it a week ago? Time sure flies when you're... (pauses) oh yes! I went to my grandson's birthday party and he turned six, just like that! Anyway, this fever... it's got me feeling quite miserable. And there's this headache... not too bad, but enough to keep me up. Now, let me think... constipation and diarrhea, that's what I've been experiencing. Can't seem to eat much of anything lately... you know how it is when your stomach just won't cooperate? (chuckles) Just like my aunt Edna used to say...","I'm not feeling too good, Doc... (pauses) You know, I was thinking about that time I went on a picnic with the grandkids... We had a big ol' turkey sandwich and some coleslaw... (chuckles) My, those were the days! Now, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, here they are.

Now, what was it you wanted to know? Oh right, my symptoms. Well, like I said, I've got this fever at night, it's just awful. Can't get a wink of sleep. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I used to take care of my brother during his illness...? Goodness gracious, that was a long time ago...

Oh yes, the symptoms! As I was saying, there's this fever, and then some headaches too. A bit of a headache, not too bad, but enough to be noticeable. (pauses) You know what would help? Some fresh air. We used to have a garden in our backyard... Now, where did I put that picture of it?

Constipation, yes... That's been going on for a few days now. Can't seem to go like I used to. And then there's the diarrhea. It comes and goes, like the weather these days. (chuckles) One day it's sunny, next day it's raining cats and dogs!

And food? Oh dear, no appetite at all! Not even for my favorite soup... You know what would be nice? A nice bowl of vegetable soup... I used to make it for my husband when he was feeling under the weather...

I'm getting a bit mixed up now. (pauses) What were we talking about again? Ah yes, the symptoms! Now, let me see if I can remember everything..."
145,Typhoid,"I've been having a lot of trouble staying hydrated because of the vomiting and diarrhea. I have a high fever, constipation, and a headache. I am also starting to get a strange pain in my stomach area and I can't do anything physical.","""Well, doc... um... excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. It's been acting up something awful. This vomiting and diarrhea business... (pauses) You know, I was watching that show with the nice young folks on it yesterday, and they were having some sort of problem with their kitchen sink. Never mind. As I was saying, this fever, it's got me feeling like I'm burning up inside. Constipation, too - can't go to the bathroom when I need to, you know? And then there's this... (hesitates) ache in my stomach. It's a bit like when I had that gallbladder trouble years ago, but not quite right. Can't do anything physically without wincing. (pauses, lost in thought) Did I tell you about the time my granddaughter came over and...? Oh dear, where did I put those reading glasses?""","I'm so glad you're here... I've been having the worst time with this... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my aunt Edna, she had a similar problem when she was younger... (trails off) Anyway... as I was saying... it's this vomiting and diarrhea that's got me so... so... (stammers) parched all the time. Can't seem to drink enough water, no matter how hard I try.

And then there's the fever. Oh dear, I've had it for days now. My husband says it's gotten worse, but I'm not sure when that was. Did we go out to dinner last night? (pauses) Ah yes, the constipation... it's been a real issue, especially since my mother passed away. She always said, ""Take some Beano, dear."" (chuckles)

And this pain in my stomach... it's hard to describe. It's like someone's poking at me with a stick, but not really. You know what I mean? (laughs nervously) My sister-in-law had something similar once, I think it was appendicitis or something... anyway... the point is, I'm getting these sharp pains and I don't know what to do about them.

And my headache... oh boy, that's a real doozy. Can't even move without feeling like someone's hammering away at me. I swear, I think it started after that big storm we had last week... (trails off)"
146,Typhoid,"I have been getting a headache for the past week that has been growing worse. It has been accompanied by stomach pains, constipation, and diarrhea. I don't know what is happening and I am really worried about it.","You know, doc... I've been gettin' these headaches for, well, let me see... (pauses) Ah yes! A week now? Maybe longer? Time flies when you're busy, like last Thursday I was fixin' my grandchild's bicycle... (trails off) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the headache. It's been gettin' worse, doc. The pain's in my temples, like someone's poundin' a hammer. And then there's these stomach pains... (hesitates) Constipation, I think it is. No, wait, that's not right... my sister-in-law had constipation last year, wasn't it? Or was it diarrhea? (chuckles) Oh dearie me... anyway, it's been switchin' back and forth like a pendulum. I'm gettin' all confused... what with the pain in my side, doc...","Oh dearie me... headachey for a week now, doc... or is it two? Wait, no, I remember distinctly, my sister Edna's birthday party last year, I was dancing with her friends and we were all laughing so hard... anyway, my head achy. Been gettin' worse, like a fog comin' in on a cold morning, you know?

Stomach's been actin' up too. Painful cramps, doc. Like someone's twistin' a knife inside me. Constipation one day, diarrhea the next... what's goin' on? Can't even eat my oatmeal without feelin' sick to my stomach. My husband, George, he said I should try some of those digestive teas, but I don't know if that'll help...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! Headache. So it started with this... this pressure on the side of my head. Throbbin', like a drumbeat. I'd get these flashes of heat, like someone's poured hot water on me from the shower... (chuckles) No, not the shower, silly! Just this... this feeling.

You know, it reminds me of when I had the flu back in '52. My mother made me chicken soup and it helped with the fever. But this isn't just a cold or flu, no sirree..."
147,Typhoid,"I've lost a lot of weight in the last week because I couldn't eat much due to nausea and vomiting. This is followed by a high fever, headache, and stomach pain.","You know, I've lost a lot of weight in the last week... or was it two weeks? Oh dear, I always get those days mixed up. Anyway, I couldn't eat much because I felt queasy all the time. Nausea and vomiting, you see. It's been a real struggle. Reminds me of that time my husband took me to the beach, and I got food poisoning from eating a bad clam... (chuckles) Ah, yes, now where was I? Oh right. So, after the vomiting stops, I get this high fever - 102 degrees, I think it said on my thermometer. Headache's been awful too, like someone's pounding on my temples with a hammer. And then there's the stomach pain... or is it my back that hurts? (pauses) Ah, yes, stomach pain. It's been keeping me up at night, poor sleep... (trails off)","I'm so sorry, doctor... (pauses) I think I left the stove on at home... anyway... where was I? Oh yes, I've been feeling just terrible lately. (hesitates) Nausea and vomiting, you see... my stomach's been churning like a washing machine. (chuckles) I remember when our old washing machine used to break down all the time... anyway...

It started with not being able to eat much at all. I lost weight in just one week! Can you believe it? (pauses) Now, where did I put that recipe book... my sister gave it to me, but I think I left it on the kitchen counter... or was it the living room table?

Oh dear, excuse me, doctor. As I was saying, this nausea and vomiting, followed by... (pauses again) what's the word I'm thinking of? Ah yes! A fever! High fever, doctor. And a headache that won't quit. My poor head feels like it's going to burst. (laughs) Just like when my brother used to blow up balloons for our birthday party...

And then there's this stomach pain... (pauses once more) Wait, I think I left the phone on the coffee table... or was it in the bathroom? Oh dear me! Focus, Agnes, focus! Ah yes, the stomach pain. It's been bothering me something fierce. I can barely stand up straight without feeling like I'm going to double over. (pauses) Now, what day is today?"
148,Typhoid,"I am having some diarrhea and constipation, which has been quite concerning. In my stomach, there is a severe, painful ache. I'm constantly exhausted and don't feel like eating anything.","Oh dearie me... I'm having some trouble with my bowel movements, doc... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about when I was a young girl, my grandmother used to make these wonderful sugar cookies... Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, diarrhea and constipation. It's been quite concerning, really. My stomach, it hurts so much... (hesitates) What was the name of that new medicine I'm supposed to be taking? Oh dear, I always get those names mixed up... 

In my stomach, there is a severe, painful ache... like someone's stabbing me with a fork. No, no, not a fork... a knife! (chuckles) Oh dear, focus, focus... And then there's this exhaustion. I'm constantly tired, don't feel like eating anything. Even the thought of food makes me queasy... (pauses) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She had some kind of stomach trouble too... Now what was it called again?","I don't know if I'm supposed to be here today, but my gut's been acting up something fierce... Diarrhea one day, constipation the next. It's like my insides are doin' flips in there. And this ache... (pauses) You know, I had a similar thing when I was on that cruise with my sister-in-law back in '92? Must've been the seafood or somethin'. Anyway, this pain in my stomach is severe, dear me. It's like someone's stickin' a knife right through my... (pauses again) Oh, what's that word I'm thinkin' of? You know, when you're feelin' all gassy and bloated?

Oh, yes! Bloating! That's it. My stomach's been actin' up somethin' awful. And the exhaustion, doctor... (pauses once more) I swear, I must've gotten older overnight. Can't remember the last time I felt like eatin' a full meal without gettin' queasy afterward. Now, where did I put my teeth? I know I had 'em in this mornin', but now they're... (stops mid-sentence) Ah, yes! My stomach's been achin' so bad, it's like a knot is tied up inside me. All the time, day and night. I try to eat somethin', anything, but nope. Just can't seem to keep food down.

You know, I was talkin' to my neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, yesterday... (trails off) What were we discussin'? Ah yes! My plants! I need to water those tomatoes or they'll shrivel up like me when the winter comes. Oh dear, where's my tea? I just made a fresh cup, but now it's gone... (laughs nervously)"
149,Typhoid,"I've been having diarrhoea and loose, watery stools many times a day. I've lost my appetite and am always sick. I'm also developing a mild fever. Also, my abdominal part pains a lot. I don't know what the reason behind all of these is.",".. umm... I've been having this problem for a bit now. Diarrhoea, yeah, loose stools, watery, you know? Many times a day, I'm afraid. Can't keep nothing down. Lost my appetite completely, doc. I mean, I love my breakfasts, always did, but now... well, can't even think about it. (pauses) I had the most wonderful scrambled eggs just last week, at Mary's house... or was it Helen? Anyway...

Oh, and this fever business. Mild, I suppose. Not too bad. But it's been sticking around for a bit longer than I'd like. Umm... days, weeks... (trails off) When did we get that new neighbor? The one with the garden? Ah yes, Mr. Johnson! No, wait...

( returns to the topic)

My stomach's been killing me, doc. Abdominal pains, lots of them. Can't even sit still sometimes. Don't know what's going on or how to fix it... (trails off again) You know, I remember when my grandmother used to make these wonderful chicken soups for us. Always felt better after one...","I've been havin' such a time with my... um, you know, what do they call it? Diarrhea! That's right! And it's not just that I'm goin' to the bathroom all the time, no sir. It's like water. Water everywhere. I mean, I've seen some things in my day, but this is somethin' else. (pauses) Oh boy, I remember when... oh wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The diarrhea. And my stomach hurts something fierce. Abdomen, that's the word. Pains a lot.

Now, let me think on this for a sec... (pauses) You know, I've been feelin' kinda off for days now. Lost my appetite, too. Don't even want to eat nothin'. Not even my favorite soup, and I love my soup! (chuckles) What was the other thing? Oh yes! Fever. Mild fever, they call it, but I don't know if that's just what they say or not.

Now, where did I put my... uh, reading glasses? Ah yes, right here on the table. (pauses to look at something else in the room) Hmm, now that I think about it, I used to have a friend whose sister had some kind of stomach trouble like this. Now what was her name? (sighs) Oh well.

Anyway, doc... or whoever's listenin', I don't know what's goin' on with my insides, but somethin' needs fixin'. That's for sure."
200,Impetigo,I have developed a skin rash on my face and neck. The rash is made up of red sores that are blistering. I am worried about my health.,"Let me tell you, Doc... I'm gettin' on in years now, and I'm startin' to feel like I'm breakin' down too. Anyway, this rash... uh... what was it they called it last time I saw someone? Oh dear, it's been a while since I saw the doctor... anyway, it's on my face and neck now, and it's got these big red sores that are blist... er, blistering. Can you imagine? I was at the park with Helen - no, wait, was it Margaret? Hmm... doesn't matter. Oh yes! The rash. So it started a few days ago, or was it last week? Time just slips right on by when you're my age... (chuckles) anyway, this rash is worryin' me somethin' fierce.","Wait, what was I tellin' ya? Oh right, my skin... (pauses) It started a few days ago, I think. No, wait, was it last week? Anyway, there's this rash on my face and neck. Now, I don't know if I told you about my cousin Edna... she had some sort of rash too, but it was all over her body. (chuckles) Good Lord, what a mess that was.

Where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's got these red sores on 'em, and they're blistering, bless my soul. It hurts like the dickens when I try to scratch 'em, but you know what they say: ""stop scratchin', it'll make it worse."" (pauses) Now, let me think... did I take my medication yesterday? Hmm...

As I was sayin', this rash is makin' me worry about my health. I don't want to be one of them people who's always gettin' sick, like Aunt Margaret. She's got some sorta chronic condition... what was it called again? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm forgettin' things these days...

Anyway, back to this rash. It seems like it's spreadin', but not too fast, thank goodness. Now, I just need you to take a look at it and tell me what I should do. Don't want no complications or anything... (pauses again) Did I turn off the stove?"
201,Impetigo,"I have developed skin rashes made up of blistering sores. The blistering sores are raised, fluid-filled lesions and they are painful to touch. I am also suffering from a high fever.","You know, Doc... (pauses) I've been having this trouble with my skin, and I'm not sure when it started exactly... was it last week? Or maybe a bit before that? No, no, wait, I had that appointment at the... um, what's-his-name's office... (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway...

So, I've got these blisters on my arms and legs. They're raised, like little bumps, but they're all filled with liquid, you see? And they hurt when I touch 'em. It's quite uncomfortable, to be honest. (pauses) Reminds me of that time I went to the beach as a young woman... got a sunburn something awful...

Oh, and another thing - my temperature, it's been running high. Fever, yes, that's what they call it, don't they? (laughs) I think I had one last year too... or was that just a cold? Ah, anyway... the doctor said to take some medication for it, but this other thing with the blisters...","Oh dear... skin rashes, you see... blisters all over... can't even walk without wincin'. Raised, fluid-filled lesions... like little balloons on my skin. And they hurt, oh boy, hurts so much when I touch 'em.

I don't know how long it's been goin' on, time just gets away from ya, you know? My sister had a rash like that once... or was it my cousin? Ah, no matter now. Anyway... I'm gettin' feverish too. Can't shake this chills, like someone poured ice water down my back.

What's the word I'm thinkin' of? Uh... oh yes! Diarrhea. Been havin' stomach problems lately. Maybe that's related? I mean, all these symptoms, might be connected. Don't know how to explain it, just feel so... tired all the time.

I remember when I was young, we didn't have all these new medicines and whatnot. Just plain old folk remedies. My grandmother used to make me tea from... uh... (pauses) Wait, what was it again? Ah, yes! Chamomile! Used to calm me down.

Anyway... this rash, it's gettin' worse. Can't sleep at night, all I can feel is these blisters... and the fever. Oh dear, feels like I'm gettin' worse by the day. Need somethin' for this, doc. (pauses) What was that word I wanted to say? Oh yes! Antibiotics!"
202,Impetigo,I have a high fever. There are red sores developing near my nose. The sores are painful and have yellow rust-colored ooze coming out from them.,"Oh dearie me... I got this high fever now. Been feeling like I've been hit by a truck all day. What was it today? Monday, Tuesday? Shoot, can't keep track no more! Anyway, I woke up feelin' like the flu again. Red sores started appearin' near my nose. No, not exactly near, but... you know what I mean. They're these little bumps now, and they hurt somethin' fierce. And this yellow goo's comin' outta 'em. Looks like rust, like when you leave a pipe outside too long. Reminds me of the time I had to replace my roof last year, and... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, these sores. They're makin' me feel just awful.","(Background noise of a warm room with TV on in the background) Oh boy... I don't know what's goin' on, Doctor. (pauses) My fever's been awful high for days now. High as it can be, my grandson says. Reminds me of that time when... (chuckles) no, not that one... Oh yes! When the flu went around in '57! We had to take it easy for weeks. Anyway... (clears throat)

Red sores, they're called... I don't know what those things are called. Near my nose, and they hurt something awful. Throbbin' pain, like when you get a toothache, ya know? And then there's the ooze... yellow, like rust on an old car. (chuckles) We had to scrape that off my father-in-law's old Ford once. What was it? Ah yes! Rust!

Now, what was I sayin'? Oh right! Sores and fever. Can't remember when this started. Was it Monday or Tuesday...? Doesn't matter now, anyway. Been takin' some of those tablets you prescribed me for my arthritis, but they don't seem to be helpin'. Unless it's just my imagination runnin' wild again, like them times I thought the dog was barkin' at ghosts in our backyard. (laughs)

Anyway, my legs feel like lead, and I'm so thirsty all the time... Water won't stay down, you see. Like when we went on that trip to the mountains last year... The altitude, dear Lord! We had to stop every five minutes for... (trails off) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, the fever and them red spots..."
203,Impetigo,"There are rashes around my nose, with large red sores. I noticed that the rash was spreading to other parts of my body. Also, I have a high fever every night.","You know, I was at the church bake sale last week... and I saw Mrs. Johnson's granddaughter, what's-her-name... you know, with the curly hair? Anyway... my skin, it's been acting up somethin' awful. There are these rashes around my nose, big red sores, just like my sister had that one time. And they're spreadin', I swear, to other parts of my body now too. I noticed that yesterday, or was it the day before? Uh... Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up! (chuckles) Anyway, it's been gettin' worse, and I have a fever every night. It's high, like 102, maybe more?","I don't know what's going on with me... (pauses) I was just thinking about my cousin Edna's brother-in-law, you know? He had a rash like this once... (stammers) or was it his sister? Anyway, he went to the doctor and got some cream for it. But mine's not getting better, no sirree. It started around my nose, these big red sores, I don't know what they're called... (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe book? I had it right here on the counter...

Um, what was I saying? Ah yes, the rash! So, it's spreading all over me. I saw this one patch on my arm yesterday and I thought, ""Good Lord, not there too!"" (giggles) And then last night, I got this awful fever. Every single night, it's like clockwork. High as a kite, I'm telling you. My grandson Jimmy was here visiting, and he said, ""Grandma, you're burning up!"" (laughs) Kids these days... He's always teasing me about something.

Now, where did I put that tea kettle? I need to make some chamomile for my arthritis... (gets distracted) You know, I used to have a lovely garden out back. My roses were the envy of the neighborhood! (pauses, looks around) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, this rash. I've been trying to get it to go away with some ointment from the pharmacy... (hesitates) Does that sound right?"
204,Impetigo,I have been suffering from a high fever for the last couple of days. Sores are developing near my nose. The sores are painful and I am feeling very uncomfortable these days.,"""Oh dear, doc... I've had this high fever for, uh, must be three days now? Or is it four? Time just flies by when you're my age, you know? Anyway, I was saying, these sores near my nose, they're gettin' worse and all. Real painful, too. Makes me feel like I've got a case of the measles or somethin'. Speakin' of which, I saw that young whippersnapper next door get 'em when he was a kid... He's fine now, but it did take him down for a week or two... Where was I? Ah yes, these sores. They're red and inflamed, like... like a rash, almost. Don't know what's causin' 'em, though.""","Oh dear, doctor... high fever... been like this for a couple of days now... (pauses) You know, I was thinking about my garden today, and those tomatoes just won't stop growing! (chuckles) I swear, they're taking over the entire backyard... anyway... sores. Yes, near my nose. Painful business, let me tell you... feels like someone's poking a fork in there all the time. (taps nose)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the fever... been feeling quite miserable, if you know what I mean... (pauses to collect thoughts) You see, I remember when my sister had this awful cough... must've been 20 years ago... or was it my cousin? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, anyway! It's a sore throat, but near the nose, you understand? And it's burning... like someone poured hot sauce in there. Can't sleep at night because of it.

Now, what else was I saying? Ah yes, the high fever! Been trying to eat some soup and stuff, but I'm just not hungry anymore... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time my neighbor's cat got stuck in a tree? Goodness gracious, what a mess that was! (laughs) No, no, focus, Edna... sores near nose... high fever. Uncomfortable is an understatement..."
205,Impetigo,"My skin has developed rashes, mainly near the nose. The rash is spreading to other parts of my body. I am really about worried about this.","I'm gettin' these rashes, doc... right here near my nose. And now they're spreadin' everywhere, I swear. My granddaughter says I look like a tomato or somethin'. (chuckles) You know, I was thinkin', what's the name of that new medication for skin conditions? That one with the... uh, the pill thingy. Anyway...

It started about... oh, last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Hmm... time flies when you're old like me! (laughs) My daughter said I should see a doctor, but I'm thinkin', ""What's the big deal?"" Now my arms and legs are all pruney... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh right! The rashes. They're gettin' worse by the day. I'm really worried about this, doc...","Um, doc... *ahem* Oh dear, I'm gettin' these rashes now. Right by my nose. And they're gettin' all over the place, ya know? Like that one time I got chicken pox as a kid... (pauses) Wait, was it chicken pox or mumps? Hmm... *chuckles* Oh well.

Where was I? Ah yes, these rashes. They're red and itchy and... (sighs) what's the word I'm thinkin' of... Oh dear, it'll come to me eventually. And they're gettin' bigger! Spreading like wildfire, I swear. I don't know if it's my fault or something in the air... *mumbles* Air pollution? No, no, that can't be it.

I'm worried sick about this, doc. My skin's not what it used to be. (pauses, looks around) Now where did I put that cream of tartar? I need to make some shortbread cookies for the church bake sale... *trails off*

Rashes, yeah... They're like little bumps and they hurt when I scratch 'em. Scratch, scratch, scratch... *taps foot impatiently* Oh dear, I'm gettin' a bit of a rash on my hands now too! On both hands? Must be the soap... or was it the laundry detergent? (chuckles)

You see, doc, my sister had eczema something fierce. Poor thing. Always breakin' out in hives... (pauses) Wait, was that her or me? Hmm... *laughs nervously*

I'm gettin' a bit of a worry now... Should I be worried about... (stammers) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinkin' of! You know, when you have those rashes and they turn into blisters? Eczema? Erythema? Something like that. *sighs* I hope it's not serious..."
206,Impetigo,I have been experiencing extreme fatigue and a high fever. There are rashes near my nose and mouth. The rash is itchy and makes it very difficult for me to sleep.,"You know, I've been feeling just terrible lately... (pauses) My grandson Jimmy came over yesterday and we watched the game together, you know? (chuckles) Anyway... I have this awful fatigue. Can't even get out of bed most mornings. And my temperature's always high, I swear it's like 102 degrees sometimes. (hesitates) Oh dear, what was I saying about Jimmy again? Ah yes, no, that's not important.

The rash is around my nose and mouth, can you believe it? It's so... (pauses, searching for words) ...itchy! Makes me want to scratch all night long. Can't sleep a wink with this thing on my face. I think it started... umm... last week? Or was it the week before that? Time flies when you're having fun, right? Anyway, it's been going on for days now and I just can't shake it off.","You know, I've been feeling just terrible lately... can't get out of bed most days. Fatigue, that's what my granddaughter said it was called... (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes! The fever. It's been going on for weeks now. Can't seem to shake it off no matter how many cups of tea I drink. And then there's these... rashes. Near my nose and mouth. Yeah, that's right. (chuckles) My late husband used to get those too, you know. Always said it was a sign of some allergy or other.

But these ones are itchy, oh boy! Keeps me up all night trying to scratch 'em. Can't sleep at all. And I've been having the most dreadful dreams... (trails off) Oh, what was the name of that movie I saw last week? You know, the one with the old lady who could talk to animals? (pauses again) Ah yes! Now where was I? The rashes... they're red and blotchy. Look like some kind of fungus or something.

I've been taking this medication... what's it called? (taps fingers on knee) No, no, I remember now: Tylenol. Been taking that for the fever, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good. And my legs, oh dear! They're all achy and stiff too. Must be connected somehow. I swear, when I was a young woman... (launches into a tangent) You know, we used to go dancing every week, Waltz, Tango, the works! My husband would spin me around so fast... (trails off again) Sorry, what was I saying? Ah yes, my legs..."
207,Impetigo,"I am suffering from extreme fever and weakness. I have developed sores on my face. The sores itchy and uncomfortable. Often, a yellow colored ooze comes out of the sores.","""Oh dear, I'm feeling just awful, Doc... fever's been high, weakness too... can't even get outta bed, ya know?

No, wait, was it the week before? Oh dear, I get all mixed up... anyway, sores on my face, and this fever's just killin' me. You know, reminds me of my sister Edna, she had something like that once... or was it my cousin? Anyway, that yellow stuff, is that normal? I hope it ain't nothin' too serious...""","I don't know what's wrong with me... I've had this fever for days now... and my bones feel like lead. My body just feels so heavy, you know?

My sister and I would compete to see who could hold their breath the longest... (trails off)

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, my fever... it's just awful. And these sores on my face, they itch something fierce. Can't even think straight with them itching like that... (taps hand on armrest) You know what would be nice right now? A cup of tea. I could swear I had some Earl Grey in the cabinet... (looks around)

Now, about these sores... (pauses to think) They're yellow and... and oozy. That's the word: oozy. Yeah, that's it. A yellow goo comes out of them. And they hurt, too. My face feels all... puffy. You know how you get when you eat too much salt? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting old...

Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes! The sores. They're just the worst. Make me feel like I've got a bad case of sunburn or something. Although, I did have some sunburn once... at the beach... (trails off again)"
208,Impetigo,I have noticed that the sores are taking longer to heal and are more prone to infection. The sores on my face are swollen and tender to the touch and very uncomfortable to handle.,"I'm gettin' these sores again... on my face, you know? And they just won't heal like they used to. It's been... um... two weeks now? Maybe three? I don't know, time slips away from me so fast nowadays... Anyway, the ones on my cheek are swollen and sore to the touch. Very uncomfortable, dear... can't even eat my soup without wincin' in pain. And then there's the one above my lip... it's been infected again, that nasty redness is back. I swear, I saw my sister's husband has that same kind of thing last year... was it Tom? No, Bob... something like that.","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... I mean, I've been noticin' these sores on my face, and they just won't heal like they used to... (pauses) Now, let me think about this... was it the chicken soup? I swear I had some good ol' fashioned chicken soup when I was a kid, and it always helped with them colds... anyway...

So, these sores... they're swollen now. Yeah, that's the word. Swollen. And tender to the touch, you know? Don't like nobody touchin' 'em no more. (chuckles) Reminds me of when I was a young woman, I had this big ol' zit on my face for weeks... (trails off)

Oh, right! The sores! They're more prone to infection now too. Don't know if it's the soap or what, but they just seem to be... sittin' there, waitin' to get infected. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about my Aunt Edna? She had some kind of skin condition when she was younger... something with her allergies, I think. Anyway...

The sores on my face... they're very uncomfortable. Don't know how else to describe it. They just... throb. Yeah, that's the word. Throb and ache at the same time. (sighs) You'd think by now, after all these years, my body would've figured out how to heal itself... but nope... (chuckles wistfully) I guess you're gettin' older when you start expectin' things like that to just fix themselves, huh?"
209,Impetigo,There are red sores on my face and near my nose. I have noticed that the rash is spreading more quickly on my neck and chest.,"""Oh dear doctor, I'm afraid I've got these... red sores on my face and near my nose. You see, I was at the grocery store yesterday, and I saw those newfangled TVs they're selling now. Big screens, just like that one my son-in-law has at home... anyway... 

The rash is spreading more quickly on my neck and chest, I've noticed. It's been a few days... or was it weeks? Time sure flies when you get older, don't you think? Ah yes, the sores. They're itchy, but not too painful, thank goodness.

I remember when my cousin had a similar issue, and she said it was something about her immune system being weak. I'm no doctor, of course... (chuckles) Oh dear me, where's that tea kettle? Ah yes, now let me think...","I think I've been gettin' these... these red sores on my face, near my nose... you know? And they're all red and splotchy. Like when I was a kid, we used to get those summer rashes from playin' outside too much. (chuckles) Oh boy, I'd forget my hat and my mom would say... (pauses) wait, what were we talkin' about?

Oh yes, the rash! It's been spreadin', you see. More on my neck now, and it's even got some on my chest. I was thinkin' maybe it's from that new laundry soap I started usin'. I had a friend who said their sister used to get these rashes from... (trails off) what was her name, Edna? No, not Edna... (chuckles)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's red and itchy, you know. Makes me want to scratch it all day. But then I remember my grandma used to say, ""Don't scratch, dear, or it'll get infected."" (pauses) Did I ever tell you about my grandma? She was a great cook... (starts talking about her grandmother's cooking)

Now, what were we talkin' about again? Oh yes! The rash! It's just on the left side of my face and near my nose. I think it might be from... (pauses) you know, that time I ate those pickles? Must've been some kind of allergic reaction or somethin'."
210,Impetigo,The sores around my nose have become crusted over and are difficult to touch. A yellow-rust coloured ooze used to come out of the sores. It is taking much more time to handle.,"""Doctor... so these little things around my nose... they've gotten all crusty now. Can't even touch 'em without wincing. Used to be, there was this... this yellow stuff that'd come outta them. Oh boy, it was like nothing I ever saw before. My neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins... she had something like that once. Fussing about her cat's litter box, if you can believe it... anyway. Now it takes me forever to clean 'em up. Took me three days last week, and I don't know what day it is today... (pauses) Wait, was it Tuesday or Thursday we went to the early bird special? Ah yes, my sores! Like I said, crusty now. That yellow stuff's not comin' out like it used to...""","I don't know if I'm makin' a big deal outta this or not, but these sores around my nose... (pauses) You know what I was doin' last week? I was at the park with Edna from next door. She's got a nice garden, you should see it! Tomatoes and carrots and... (stammers) Oh dear, where was I?

Ah yes, these sores. They're gettin' all crusted up like my old shoes after a long walk. Can't even touch 'em without wincin'. Used to be, there'd be this yellow-rust stuff comin' outta 'em... (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I had that nasty cold back in 1947. No, wait, was it '48? No matter, my throat was all scratchy and— 

Focus! These sores. It's like tryin' to scrub away at them with a stiff brush. Don't wanna hurt myself, but... (pauses) I did used to be able to handle it easier. Now it takes me an hour just to get the crust off with some ointment. My husband, God rest his soul, he'd just laugh and say ""you're gettin' old, dear""... (smiling sadly) Ah, them were good times...

Anyway... these sores, like I said. They're gettin' worse. I don't know if it's just the weather changin', but... (hesitates, loses train of thought) What was I sayin'? Oh yes, sores! It's takin' forever to take care of myself now."
211,Impetigo,"I developed a minor rash near my nose a few days ago. Now, the rash is accompanied by a burning sensation and redness of the skin. I feel it is some kind of an infection.","I got this rash on my nose... um, I think it was three days ago now. Yeah, that sounds about right. My granddaughter had a birthday party last weekend and I was at her house for hours, but that's not important. Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the rash. It started off as just a little red spot, but now... now there's this burning feeling and it's all red and puffy-looking. Looks like an infection to me. I remember my cousin had something like that once... or was it my sister-in-law? Oh dear, it'll come to me eventually. Infections are always so worrisome, you know?

(pauses)

Oh, I just thought of something! I was at the farmer's market last week and I got some fresh basil for my salad. I love that stuff... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the rash. So it's been getting worse by the day, and I'm getting a bit concerned. Do you think it could be... (trails off)","I'm tellin' ya, doc... (pauses) Oh boy, I had the most wonderful cup of coffee this mornin', just like my sister used to make... anyway... (clears throat)

So, it started as a little rash near my nose. Just a tiny thing, but now it's all spread out and red. Like a rose, you know? No, not a rose, a rash! (chuckles) I don't know how long ago it was... was it last week or the week before that? Time sure flies when you're gettin' older...

Now, it burns somethin' awful. Stings like someone poured hot sauce right on my face. Can't even put makeup on it 'cause it's all puffy and red. My cousin Edna had a similar thing once... or was it her sister? (pauses) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up...

This rash is somethin' to do with infection, I'm sure of it. You know, my husband used to say we should get a dog to chase the ticks away... what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, this rash! (laughs) Sorry, sorry... where was I?

So, like I said, it started as a small rash and now... well, you see how red it is. I think maybe I ate some bad fish for lunch that day... or was it the night before? No matter, I'm tellin' ya, doc, it's one of them infections! You'll know just what to do, I'm sure... (trails off) Now, where did I put my reading glasses..."
212,Impetigo,"Initially, I developed small red sores near my nose and neck. Now, I am having a high fever and the sores have become more painful and inflamed over the past few days.","You know, I've been feeling awful for... um... three days? Or is it four? Shoot, my mind gets foggy these days. Anyway, I started with these little red bumps on my face, near my nose and neck. Thought they were just some sort of skin irritation from that new laundry soap I got. But then I came down with this nasty fever. Been taking Tylenol like crazy, but it don't seem to be helpin' much. Those sores have gotten a lot worse too... more painful and inflamed than before. My granddaughter's birthday party is next week, I hope I'm feelin' better by then...","I'm gettin' all sorts of troubles lately... small red sores near my nose and neck, I think they started about a week ago? Or was it two weeks? Shoot, I always forget what day it is anyway. (chuckles) Anyway, these little bumps were just tiny at first, but now they're bigger and more painful than you'd believe.

Fever, too... high fever, like my head's on fire or somethin'. Can't sleep, can't eat, I'm just one big ol' walking ache. Now, let me think... what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The sores. They've got some sorta fluid inside 'em now. Yellowish stuff, kinda oozy. Don't know if that's normal or not.

You know who used to take care of me? My wife Edna... she'd always make me soup when I was feelin' poorly. (pauses) Oh boy, where did my soup go? Must've eaten it all up already... (chuckles nervously) What was the question again? Ah yes! The sores... anyway, they're gettin' more inflamed every day. Hurts to touch 'em, too. (sighs)

Say, do you think I should still be gettin' those foot massages at the senior center? My feet hurt somethin' awful sometimes. And have you seen that new fella playin' cards in the park? He's got a great mustache... anyway, like I was sayin', these sores and fever business is keepin' me up all night.

I think that's it... unless I'm forgettin' somethin'. (pauses) Oh dearie me!"

I think it started last week, maybe Tuesday? Or was that my brother Ed's birthday? Anyway, I had this skin rash on my face. It was a blistering sore, real nasty lookin' thing. And today, I don't know if it's morning or afternoon now, but anyway... I saw this yellow stuff comin' out of the sores. I'm not sure what it is, could be poison ivy or somethin', I don't know. I've been scratchin' it like crazy, but it just won't go away. My wife says we should get a picture of me for the grandkids, 'cause they love seein' us old folks... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, this rash... I hope you can help me with that, doc.""","Oh dearie me, Doc... I was thinkin', what day is it again? Uh, anyway... I woke up this mornin' and my face felt like it was on fire. Now I'm pretty sure that's not a new thing for me no more, but I remembered now, oh boy! Last year when we went to the lake house with the grandkids, I got some kind of bug bite on my arm... yeah, that's right. Must've been an allergic reaction or somethin'. But anyway...

I looked in the mirror and saw these blisters on my face. Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""Ma'am, are you sure it's not just dry skin?"" And I'm like, ""Well, no... it don't feel like that."" See, I've had this one spot on my nose for a while now, and it's been gettin' bigger. Oh, shoot! Now where did I put them reading glasses? Ah yes...

Today, I looked again, and there was this yellow stuff comin' out of the sores... what is that, anyway? Is it pus or somethin'? I remember my cousin had some kind of infection once... was it his eye? Or was it his finger? Wait, where's my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here...

Oh dear, Doc, I'm gettin' all confused. Can you just take a look at this and tell me what's goin' on with my face? It's just been actin' up somethin' fierce..."
214,Impetigo,"The sores on my face are beginning to weep clear fluid. Also, every night I get a high fever and chills, because of which I cannot sleep all night.","""Oh dear, my face... well, you know what I mean... these sores on my face... they're gettin' all weepy again. Clear fluid, just like last week, or was it two weeks ago? Hmm, can't keep track of time no more. My mind's a jumble. Anyway, the doctor said it might be related to this one thing... uh, what was it called? Oh yes, rosacea! But I'm not so sure about that. Now, where was I? Ah yes, these sores. And then every night, oh dear, I get this fever, and chills, you know? Can't sleep a wink. Keeps me up all night, tossin' and turnin'. Just like when I was young and had that awful flu... (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?""","I'm gettin' these sores on my face now... can't seem to shake 'em off. You know what they call those things? Lesions or somethin'? (pauses) Oh, and I've got a picture of my grandson's birthday party from last year right here in this album... (rummages through purse) Ah, yes! Here it is! (chuckles) Look at that little scamp! Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the sores. They're beginnin' to weep clear fluid now. I'm pretty sure that's a bad sign, isn't it? (pauses)

You know what really gets me up at night? The heat! Lord have mercy, it's like my body's tryin' to cook itself from the inside out! High fever and chills every single night... can't sleep a wink. Can't even get comfortable, ya know? My back's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately too... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went on that cruise with my sister? We saw the most beautiful sunset over the ocean! (trails off)

Fever's got me all shaken, can't focus no more. Just when I think I'm gettin' some rest, it hits me like a ton of bricks – hot and cold sweats everywhere... under the blankets, on top, even in my hair! (laughs nervously) You'd think that'd be enough for one night, but no sir! That's just the start. Then there's the sores... weepin' clear fluid like nobody's business... got me a bit worried I might be gettin' sick again... (falters)

Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes, fever and chills! Got to get some sleep soon, but my body won't let up. Guess that's just part of bein' old... all these aches and pains... one day it'll catch up with me for good, mark my words! (exhales heavily)"
215,Impetigo,I initially had rashes on my face and near my nose. But now the rash is spreading down my arms and legs.,"""Ah, the rash... well, it started on my face, near my nose, I think it was about a week ago? Or maybe two weeks? Time flies when you're watching reruns of The Price is Right, don't it? Anyway, I had this red patchy thing. Now it's moving down my arms and legs, if you can call 'em that anymore... (chuckles) I swear, they shrunk since I got older! But seriously, doctor, the rash, it's like a map on my skin or something. Red blotches everywhere. I've been using that cream, you know, the one with the zinc oxide? It helped some, but now it seems to be spreading faster... Ah, what was the name of that new medication I'm taking for my blood pressure?""","Now let me think on this... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm getting all sorts of things mixed up in my head today. You see, Doc... or is that Nurse? Hmm... anyway... (chuckles) I had these little red spots, like sandpaper, on my face and near my nose. My granddaughter said they looked like measles, but I told her no, it's not that. (pauses) Now where was I?

Oh yes! The rash. It started with the rashes on my face and... (trails off) You know, I had a cousin who got skin cancer. Terrible thing. He used to work outdoors all day. (pauses again) But anyway...

Now this rash is spreading down my arms and legs. It's itchy, oh boy, it's like someone's taken a sandpaper to my skin! (laughs nervously) I'm getting old, I guess that's why... (trails off)

I remember my aunt had something similar once... or was it my mother? (chuckles) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up. (pauses, looks around the room) You know what would be nice right now is a cup of tea. Do you have any of that lovely Earl Grey?

Now where was I? Ah yes! The rash... (clears throat) It's been going on for weeks now. Or is it months? Time gets all confused when you get to my age... (laughs)

Anyway, as I was saying... the rash started on my face and near my nose, but now it's spreading down my arms and legs. Like I said, it's very itchy. And sometimes... (pauses) Now what was I going to say? Oh dear, this is like trying to remember a recipe!"
216,Impetigo,"I have a high fever every night and developed sores on my face, particularly near my nose. I have noticed that the sores are taking longer to heal and are more prone to infection.","You know, doc... I've been gettin' these high fevers every night, just as regular as clockwork, no matter how much aspirin I take... (chuckles) My wife, Edna, she says it's like somethin' out of a movie, but, uh, not in a good way. Anyway, the sores started showin' up near my nose, you see 'em? (pauses) Just under the tip, where I got that mole... and they just wouldn't heal no matter what I did. Now they're gettin' infected more often than not...

(pauses) ...this fever, it comes every night, right around bedtime. (gulps) And these sores on my face, well, they started near my nose, if you can believe it. Used to be just a little rash, but now... (hesitates) ...now they're more like ulcers, I suppose. Hardly nothin' seems to help 'em heal proper, either.

Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous sugar cookies? (chuckles) My granddaughter always asks me to make those for her birthday party. (pauses again) Ah yes, the sores! It's like they're... (struggling to find words) ...infected all the time. Antibiotics don't seem to do much good, and I'm gettin' a bit worried, to be honest. My sister-in-law had something similar when she was young... or was it her daughter? (confused) Wait, which one of 'em had that thing with their skin?

Anyway... (trails off) Ah, yes! The fever! It's like my body's just... (shaking head) ...on fire at night. Can't sleep for the sweatin' and shakin'. My cat used to do that, too. Poor thing would pace back and forth, keepin' me awake half the night. (chuckles softly) I miss ol' Whiskers...

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The sores. Like I said, they just won't heal right. It's... (pauses again, collecting thoughts) ...so frustrating, like there's somethin' just underneath the surface, botherin' me somethin' fierce.

I'm not sure if I mentioned this before, but... (pauses) Anyway, these sores around my nose... they've gotten a lot worse, if you know what I mean. Now there's this red skin around them, all inflamed and sore-looking. Like when I was young and had that nasty acne on my face... (trails off)

Oh, yes! And the rash! It's all dry and flaky now. My grandmother used to get those kinds of rashes on her legs during the summer. She said it was from swimming in the lake too much. (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, these sores... The skin around them is just so thin and tender now.

There's this yellow stuff coming out of 'em, like when you squeeze a... a grape, no, not a grape... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting all confused. Anyway, there's this yellow fluid. It's just... it's quite unpleasant, really. (pauses again)

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I could've sworn I left them right here on the table... (searches around) Ah, never mind! The sores and rashes, yes... They're quite a nuisance, to be honest with you. I just wish it would go away already!"

Fever, yes... and I think it's been going on for three days now? Maybe four? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up. My friend Margaret, she always says I'm good with dates. (pauses again)

These red rashes, they're near my nose and lips, like a little patchwork quilt or something... itchy, that's the word. Uncomfortable, too. I try to scratch, but then it just gets worse. (giggles) Like when I used to get these awful mosquito bites on our summer vacations...

Blistering sores? Is that what they're called? Yeah, I think so... (stammers) or maybe they said I had a cold? No, no, I'm sure it was fever. Flu-like symptoms, is that right? The doctor's always saying these medical words... (sighs)

Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Now I remember, the nurse at the hospital said something about it being a bit of a rare case... (trails off again) Rare, what does she mean by that? Rare like me or something? (laughs nervously)"

Made my wife so cross, I swear she was gonna... *trails off*

Now where did I put those flowers? Ah yes, anyway... this headache of mine. A bit on the left side, if you know what I mean. Like someone's hammerin' away with a mallet. No, wait, that's just my nephew Tommy's toy chest. He's always bangin' away in there...

Oh dear, sores! Near my nose, yes... small ones, don't worry about it. Probably just a scratch from when I was out in the garden last week. Got some of those pesky thorns on that rose bush... you remember that bush? No, no, never mind.

Rashes on my neck, is what I said, wasn't I? *pauses* Don't get me wrong, doc, it's not like I'm one of them hippies with their painted faces or anythin'! *chuckles* Lord have mercy, where was I?

My wife says I'm gettin' all worked up over nothin', but I know how I feel. This tough time... you see, we just lost our cat, Whiskers, and... well, never mind about that. It's this... fever business and the pain in my head... you'll take care of me, won't you?"

(pauses)","Oh dearie me... rashes on my face... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about that time I went to the beach with my cousin... (trails off) Wait, where was I? Oh yes, the rash! It's been there for a few weeks now. At first, it was just little bumps, but then they started to blister and turn into sores. And around my nose, you know, the bridge of my nose... (pauses again)

It's like a big ol' sore is growing right on top of my face. And I'm getting these tiny little sores everywhere else too. My ears, my neck, even on my hands. (suddenly concerned) Do you think it's something I caught from someone? I was at the church last week... (stops abruptly)

Anyway, like I said, there are sores all over my face and nose, and sometimes a yellow liquid comes out of them. It's very painful, dear doctor. Very painful. I'm talking throbbing, burning... (pauses to collect thoughts) And what's this? Did I have something on the tip of my tongue just now? Oh, it was nothing! (chuckles)

I think I might've forgotten my tea, too... (trails off again) Ah yes, the rash. Like I said, it's been a few weeks. I've tried putting some cream on it, but that only makes it worse. And the pain, oh boy... It feels like someone poured acid all over me."
225,Impetigo,"I am feeling really sick. I have a high fever and headache. I noticed rashes on my arms and face. I am extremely worried about this. Today, I observed red sores near my nose.","Let me tell you, Doc... or is it Dr. Smith? Ah, yes, I'm sure it is... anyway, I've been feeling just awful. Fever's through the roof, must be a hundred and four, at least. And this headache, oh boy... it's like someone's hammerin' away in my brain. Now, about these rashes... they started on my arms, then moved to my face. My goodness gracious, I'm gettin' old, what with forgettin' where I put my teeth... (chuckles) Ah yes! The rashes. They're red and itchy, just dreadful. And today, now that you mention it, I did see some sores near my nose... or was that yesterday? (pauses)","I'm feelin' just awful, doc... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my tea? Ah yes, now... high fever and headache, you see. Can't seem to shake it off.

Anyway... rashes on my arms and face. I've been meanin' to show 'em to you, but I keep forgettin'. (rummages through purse) Oh dear, where did I put those pictures of my grandkids? Ah yes! Here they are... (holds up a photo album)

Where was I? Ah yes, the rashes. They're all red and itchy, like when I got that new soap last week. (pauses) You know, I think I might've gotten it from the soap... or maybe it's this weather we've been having. Always makes me break out. (mutters to self) Must get some aloe vera...

And then there are these sores near my nose. Red and painful, just like that time... (pauses, confused) What was I sayin'? Ah yes! My husband had those sorts of sores before he passed away... or was it my sister? (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up...

Anyways... I do hope you can help me figure out what's goin' on. This fever and rashes are just frightenin'! (gulps) I don't know what to do..."

And then there's these rashes... uh, where did I get that picture of my grandkids? Ah yes, the ones from Hawaii! Sweet memories... oh dear, focus, Bob. Where was I? Ah yes, the sores and rashes. They're all over, on my arms, legs, back... and they hurt, doc, they really do.""","I... uh... well, Doc... I've been feeling just terrible for a while now. High fever, you see. Been running like a faucet, and my throat is so sore... all the time. Can't even swallow properly. Now, where did I put that aspirin? Ah yes, I think I left it in the kitchen. Anyway...

These sores on my face, around my nose... they're quite painful, you know. Like when you get a paper cut, but much worse. And then there are these rashes all over my body. Legs, arms, even my back. Don't know what to make of 'em. I've had some sort of rash before, wasn't it... (pauses) No, no, that was my sister's husband... anyway...

I'm getting on in years, you know. Maybe this is just part of growing older? But these sores and rashes, they're making me feel quite uneasy. I wake up at night with a start, thinking about what might be wrong with me. Did I take my medication today? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up...

I remember when my neighbor had this thing... what was it called? Ah yes, shingles! She got those and they took ages to clear up. Now, if I could just remember where I put that tea kettle... (pauses) Oh, right! The sores and rashes. Just like she had. Yes, I'm sure of it."

A yellow ooze frequently leaks from the wounds.,"""Fever's been going on for... um, I think three days now? Maybe four? Don't rightly know. It's got me feelin' like a sack of potatoes. Can barely get outta bed. My face, it's all broken out. Got these sores, blisters they are, and boy do they itch somethin' fierce. Makes me want to scratch 'em till I bleed, but then there's this ooze... yellow, y'know? Comes leakin' out like nobody's business. Reminds me of the time my cousin Edna got a bad case of poison ivy, that stuff just wouldn't quit. Anyway... fever. Yeah, that's it. Been feelin' pretty crummy.""","I don't know if I'm gettin' a cold or what it is... but I've had this high fever for days now...

My face, it's all... sore. Got these blisters on 'em. Itch like crazy, burnin' too. Can't even scratch 'em without wipin' away tears... (sighs) I swear, I'm gettin' old. My skin's just not what it used to be...

Now, let me think... when did this start? Was it after that trip to the park with my friend Edna? Or was it before? (pauses, looks around the room) Wait, where am I? This isn't the living room, is it? (laughs nervously)

Oh dear, focus. The sores... they keep leakin' this yellow stuff. It's like a thick goo. Ugh! And now my back's actin' up too... can't even walk without wincin'. (pauses) I had the most wonderful time at the lake last summer... didn't I? We caught some big ol' fish, and then there was that picnic... (trails off)

What was I sayin'? Ah yes! The fever. I've been sweatin' buckets, but no relief. Just feels like my body's tryin' to... (pauses again) You know what they used to call it when we were kids? ""The breakin' out""? That's what this is, ain't it? The breakin' out... (nods confidently)"

(shakes head) Oh dear, I forget. Anyway, it's rather uncomfortable. And the fever, oh boy... (taps forehead) 102 degrees or something like that. I took my temperature this morning. (looks around) Now where did I put those aspirin... (trails off)","I'm gettin' these skin rashes... with burnin' sores, ya see? Burnin', like when you touch hot water or somethin'.

Now, let me think... (pauses) Oh boy, I had the best chili at the church picnic last week... my sister-in-law made it, she's got that secret recipe... anyway, these sores... they're like little blisters, but not just on top of the skin, you know? There's fluid inside 'em. They're all red and elevated, stand right out from the rest of my skin.

And they hurt! Don't like to touch 'em at all. (chuckles) Guess I must've touched one wrong or somethin'... oh dear, I think I left my sweater at the church too... sorry, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, sores. I also got a fever. Pretty high, I reckon. Can't seem to shake it.

You know, when we were kids, we used to get these things on our feet from playin' outside in the mud... my brother always said it was from walkin' barefoot too long... but this ain't nothin' like that.

(chuckles) I remember when I was a kid, we used to go to the lake every summer, and my skin would get all pruney from swimmin'. (pauses again) What year was that, now? '52? '53? No, no... Oh dear, I'm gettin' old. (clears throat) The sores, yeah... they started a few weeks ago, maybe more? Time flies when you're watchin' TV all day... where's my teeth? Ah, yes! So these rashes and sores, they've just gotten worse. That yellow stuff, it's gettin' on me nerves.""","I think I got some... skin problem, yes sir... skin disease, that's what they call it, right? My daughter says I gotta go see the doctor, 'cause she seen some rashes on my face and them small sores near my nose. Now, let me think... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the sores! They're red now, all red and painful, like when I got a cold sore back in '62... or was it '63? Don't know, don't matter.

Anyway, these sores... they've got some kind of yellow stuff comin' out. Ooze, that's what I said, ooze! Yellow ooze, yeah... (pauses) I remember when my cousin had a similar thing, and she went to the dermatologist. Wait, what was her name? Oh, it'll come to me...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, them sores! They're itchin' somethin' fierce now. Must be from that new soap I started usin'. (pauses again) Or maybe it's the... uh... (chuckles) Oh dear, gettin' old, you know?

You see, it starts on my nose, but then it spreads to other places... like here (points), right on this spot. Been there for weeks now. I've been puttin' cream on 'em, but no use. Don't think the cream's workin'. Must be somethin' else. You know what? My aunt Edna had a similar problem when she was in her... um... (hesitates) sixties, I reckon.

You see, now that I'm tellin' you all this... (chuckles nervously), I think it's just my skin gettin' old like the rest of me."

Say, did I tell ya about the time I had chickenpox? Oh boy, that was a mess! Must've been '52 or '53... my mother said it lasted for weeks, and I was so itchy I thought I'd lose my mind. (chuckles) Ah, good times.

Oh, yes, these sores on my face... they're just awful. Cheeks are the worst part. Large as baseballs, painful when I touch 'em, and don't even get me started on tryin' to put stuff on 'em. Like, what's the name of that other cream... you know, the one for eczema? (pauses) Never mind.

My face is just... it's all... (sighs) Nothin' seems to be helpin'. I've been seein' a doctor friend of mine, and he says maybe I should get some more tests done. Tests, you know? Always tests. Don't know what they're gonna find, but I'm willin' to try anything at this point... (trails off)"

And then there's this rash... (pauses) You know, my cousin Edna had something similar once? I think it was rosacea, but her doctor said it was just allergies or somethin'.

No, wait, my sister-in-law's birthday was last week, and she had a party with all those young folks... (chuckles) Kids these days and their music! Anyway...

So, I'm feelin' hot, sweatin', and my skin's broken out somethin' fierce. Got this rash on my face, neck, arms – it's all red and painful. Like burnin' coals, I swear. (pauses) You know, when I was a young girl, we used to get these heat rashes in the summer. Wasn't as bad, though... or was it? (laughs)

And my joints! Good grief, they ache somethin' awful. Can't even walk without wincin'. My neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, she's got this arthritis and takes all those pills... (distracted) Did I remember to water the garden today? No, no, focus!

Now where was I? Ah yes! This rash – it's not goin' away, doc. I'm worried sick about my health. I keep thinkin' of my grandma when she got that... uh... what did they call it again? (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old and forgetful!

Fluid-filled, elevated lesions... don't know what that means, but it sounds fancy, doesn't it? My niece's husband's got a cousin who's a doctor, I think he'd know about this sort of thing. Anyway... these blisters, they're so sensitive to the touch, I try to avoid 'em if I can. And then there's my fever, high as a kite! Had it for three days now, or was it four? Can't keep track sometimes... anyway, I've been feeling awful. Took my meds this morning... what were they called again? Ah yes, the ones with the white bottle. I hope that's helping... anyway, these rashes and fever, must be connected somehow.""","I don't know if this is related but I was out in the garden last week and my grandson said I should use that new fertilizer on my tomatoes... anyway... skin rashes. Yeah, I've got those. Blistering sores, they call 'em? Fluid-filled, elevated lesions. Unpleasant to touch, just like my sister's rheumatoid arthritis... no, wait, was it her knees or hands that ached?

I remember now, we were talking about the new doctor in town and I said I'd go see him for this skin business. But what was his name? You know, with the white coat? Ah yes! The doctor with the nice glasses. So, these blisters... they're all over my body, not just one spot. And they hurt when I touch 'em. Like a bee sting.

Now, about that fertilizer... my grandson said it's got some kind of miracle ingredient in it. Gave my tomatoes a boost last summer... hmm, what was the question again? Oh right! The fever. Yes, I've had a high fever for three days now. Always feels like someone's turned up the thermostat in here. Water and tea don't seem to be helping either.

You know who used to say that a cold shower could cure anything? My mother-in-law... no, wait, that was my sister... (laughs) Oh dear! Anyway, I'm getting off track. These blisters are quite painful and they're not going away on their own, if you ask me. Must be something more serious than just a sunburn or eczema..."

(pauses) you know how sometimes your skin just gets a little... sensitive?

Now, around my nose, these red sores are forming. And they're painful, dear me! Like tiny boils or something. The doctor I saw last... umm... what's-his-name? You know, the one with the nice mustache... anyway, he said I should watch out for infections.

Oh, and I almost forgot. There's this yellow rust-colored fluid coming out of them. It's a bit gross, to be honest.

Ah yes, the temperature. It's been hovering around 102, I think. No, wait, is that normal or is it supposed to be down like that? (chuckles) Never mind.

Anyway, these little bumps are starting on my nose... (taps nose) Red ones, they're quite painful, dear me. And what's this I'm seeing? Oozing fluid? It's a bit yellowish, almost rust-colored, if you can imagine. Yes, like when the old shed in our garden would get all rusty after a rainstorm... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I?

Yes, these lesions – are they called lesions, doctor? – yes, they're painful and oozing this funny stuff... I don't want to think about it too much, if you know what I mean. (giggles nervously) And the temperature's making me all dizzy... or is that just the medication from last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Oh dear, my mind is a jumble...

And then there's the fever... yes, high temperature every night, just like my friend Mabel used to get when she had that cold... or was it a flu? (pauses) Wait, what day is today again? Ah yes, and I've got these big red sores all over... on my arms now too, I think.""","I'm not sure if this is what I had for lunch yesterday... anyway, like I was saying, these rashes around my nose, they're quite a nuisance, you know?

Can't say exactly where I first saw it... was it my arm? Or maybe my leg? Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up.

Anyway, temperature's always through the roof at night, every single night. I swear, I woke up this morning and it felt like a furnace in here! (taps chest) You know what they say, ""you're not old until..."". No, wait, that's something else entirely. Now, let me think...

Oh yes, these sores and rashes. Like I said, around my nose first, now everywhere. And this fever, it's like a regular visitor every night. (pauses) Do you know where I put my reading glasses? Must have left them... never mind.

Temperature's always high at night, like I said. Hot flashes, I suppose that's what they're called. (chuckles nervously) Now, where was I going with this again? Ah yes, the rashes and sores. And then there are these... these tiny bumps on my skin too. Tiny little things, can't quite see 'em close up... but they're there.

Now, would you like some tea, doctor? I've got a fresh pot right here..."

Can't quite recall... (chuckles) My mind's not as sharp as it used to be! Anyway, this rash... (pauses again) excuse me, what's that noise? (listens for a moment) Oh, nevermind. Where was I?

These red spots, they've been there for a few days now. At first, I thought it was just a bug bite, but then more showed up. And that rash on my neck and chest, it's spreading faster than I can... (taps fingers on armrest) ...than I can say ""bless you""! (laughs nervously)

Now, let me think where did I put those gloves? Ah yes, in the laundry basket... (pauses to dig through imaginary laundry) Oh dear, anyway...

I've also got a bit of a fever. Not too high, just a mild one. But my cousin Edna had something similar last year... or was it her sister-in-law? (shrugs) I always get those two mixed up.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's spreading, and I'm starting to worry. Maybe we should get some cream for it? Or is that what they call it when you have too much... (pauses, searching for words) ...too many spots on your face? (laughs uncertainly)

Red sores, rash, fever... does that sound right to you? (fidgets with hands) I hope I'm not making a fuss over nothing..."

It is taking a lot longer to deal with using medication.,"You know, I was just thinkin', my nasal sores have crusted up somethin' fierce now... can't hardly touch 'em without wincin'. Used to be they'd leak this yellow-rust colored fluid, but that's not happenin' as much no more. And the medication, well, it's takin' a lot longer to work its magic, if you know what I mean... like when my cousin Edna used to take those pills for her arthritis, she had to take 'em three times a day, but I forget now if that was just Tuesdays or every other Tuesday. Anyway, these sores have been troublin' me somethin' awful lately...

( pause )

Now, where's my tea? I swear, I left it right here... Ah yes! So, the medication's not workin' as quick, and those sores are all crusted up like the roof on my house last winter.","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, doc... (pauses) You know, I was just making myself a cup of tea earlier, and I thought about my aunt Edna. She always had such lovely skin, even at her age... (trails off)

(pauses, searching for words) You know what I mean? That stuff would just ooze out of them at first. Now, not so much, thank goodness.

It's just taking an awful long time to get rid of 'em, if you ask me. The medication seems to be doing its job, but... (hesitates) Wait, where was I going with that? Ah yes! The sores. Like I said, they're crusty now and it's hard to clean around 'em. I try to be gentle, don't want to make it worse... (pauses to think)

I remember when I was a young woman... we didn't have all these new-fangled treatments like we do now. We just used good old-fashioned ointments and lotions. Still, those sores took their time to clear up too... (stares off into the distance) Did I mention my aunt Edna? She had such lovely skin...

Oh dear me, what was I saying again? Ah yes! The sores. They're just taking longer than usual this time around. That's all..."

And the redness, oh boy, it's spread quite a bit. Now there's this discharge too... I don't know what to call it, pus? No, not exactly. My cousin Edna had something similar once, she said it was just a cold sore. But I've never gotten those before... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing with Edna at Lake Tahoe? Lovely spot. Where was I? Ah yes, the rash...","I'm tryin' to remember... oh dear, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes! So, I got this rash around my nose a few days ago. Tiny little thing, hardly noticeable. But then it started itch-in', and I thought maybe I just needed some cream or somethin'. But now... (pauses) ...it's all red and sore. And there's fluid comin' out! I don't like that one bit.

You know, my sister had a rash once, too. She said it was from a bug bite. But this feels different. It's like it's burn-in', ya know? (pauses again) Wait, what were we talkin' about? Oh right! The rash!

I've been tryin' to take care of myself, eatin' my vegetables... or at least I think I have. My mind's a bit foggy lately. What's that word I'm lookin' for? (chuckles) Ah well, it'll come to me eventually.

Anyway, I think it might be some sort of infection. I've been feelin' a bit off, too – my joints ache and I get these... these... (taps foot on the floor) what's the word? Oh yes! These dizzy spells. (pauses once more) Excuse me, dear, would you like a cookie? I baked 'em myself just yesterday...

Oh, right! The rash! (nervously chuckles) Yes, so it's all red and... and... (struggling to find the right word) sore-ish. And this fluid comin' out. I don't want to be one of those people who gets a serious infection, you know? (shudders)

Small red bumps they were, at first. And then... well, now I'm not feelin' too good, if you know what I mean. High temperature, yeah. My grandkids always get sick when the weather changes... did I tell you about the time my granddaughter got pneumonia? Anyway, these sores, they've gotten worse.

Point is, I'm feelin' quite miserable now.""","(Background chatter, faint TV in the distance) Oh boy, doctor... (pauses) You know what I was just thinking about? My wife's sister, she had something like this back in '82. No, wait, it was her cousin. Anyway... (chuckles)

The red sores, they started near my nose and neck, first thing I noticed. (pauses to collect thoughts) And then... (hesitates) Well, I don't rightly remember when it exactly started, but I recall being a bit warm. (stammers) You know what I mean? Warm, not hot, just a little... (trails off)

Now, now, my temperature's gone up something fierce! (pauses to catch breath) Like, it's been days since it happened... the sores, they've gotten worse. More painful and all inflamed-like. (mumbles to self) Inflamed, that's a big word... (clears throat)

I was talking to my neighbor just yesterday... he said something about shingles? No, no, I think it was chickenpox in his time. (chuckles nervously) Anyway... (pauses again) My granddaughter had those little red bumps on her hands last summer. Must've been some sort of... infection or something. (shrugs)

I do wish you'd explain to me what these sores are, doctor... (trails off, then suddenly speaks up again) Oh, and I almost forgot! I had a big ol' plate of fried chicken for dinner yesterday evening. Might be related? (laughs nervously)"

It's been getting worse over the past few days, so I reckon I should come in for an exam or something. My grandson told me it looked like some sort of skin cancer, but he's always spouting off about those health shows on TV... I don't know if that's true or not.

I've been rubbin' some cream on it, but that doesn't seem to be helpin'. I even tried some of my sister's homemade remedy – you know, the one with the tea tree oil and aloe vera... (trails off) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe? I think I might've left it at her house.

Oh, yes! The rash. It's been makin' me real self-conscious, if you know what I mean. I don't want to go out in public lookin' like this... (chuckles nervously) My grandkids are always sayin', ""Grandma, why do you have those big red spots on your face?"" And I'm thinkin', ""What am I supposed to tell 'em?""

No, no, not like that at all. This is different.

There are these sores, you see. They're open wounds, really. Yellowish fluid comes out of 'em. It looks like rust, almost. My daughter said it's an infection or something. I don't know... (trails off)

It started with just one or two on my nose... then more showed up around my mouth. Now it's everywhere. (sighs) My face feels like it's been through a war. When I was younger, my mother used to have something like this – wasn't it eczema? No, no, not exactly... Ah, it'll come to me eventually.

I just can't seem to get comfortable anymore. These sores are driving me mad! (pauses) Now, what's that thing I'm supposed to take for arthritis? My wife always remembers... (trails off again)

It's on my cheek, and it's big... real sore to touch. Red as a tomato! (laughs) My granddaughter had that once, didn't she? No, no, I'm thinkin' of my sister. Anyway...(sighs)

Burnin' sensation, like someone poured hot sauce right on it. And the skin, all red and whatnot... you know when you get sunburned and then it gets all scaly? It's like that. Except this is worse.

Anyway, this itching started a few days ago. Red bumps all over, like little... like little blisters, I suppose. I tried scratching them but, oh dearie me, that just made 'em worse! Now I've got dark spots too. Not freckles, mind you, no sir... those are nice and light... These ones are darker, like moles almost. (pauses) What was I saying? Ah yes!

And then there's these tiny bumps, nodular breakouts, the doctor said that once. Small, but they hurt a bit when I press on 'em. It's been going on for days now... or is it weeks? Time flies when you're having fun, don't it? (chuckles) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinking of?

It's getting worse, though. I can feel it spreading. Like a rash, you know? My poor skin! And I just had that new cream... what was it called again? The one with the... uh... ointment stuff in it? Ah yes! My daughter gave me some of hers. That didn't seem to help much...

Now, where did I put my reading glasses?"

Then there are these little bumps, nodular eruptions, I believe it's called? And Lord have mercy, the itching is just terrible! It's been getting worse, I'm sure of it... now, let me think... was it last week or the week before that I first noticed it getting really bad? Ugh, details always get foggy with age... anyway, my granddaughter said she saw a similar rash on one of her friends... Hmm, I wonder if I should call and ask her about it... no, focus, Margaret! Ah yes, the rash... (sigh) And it's all so red and inflamed... what am I forgetting?""","I'm so worried about this... rash thing on my skin. You see, doctor, I've had these dischromic patches for a while now. You know what I mean by that? No, no, I'm sure you do.

(pauses) ...fussing at me or something.

And the itching! Goodness gracious, it's like someone's scratching me from the inside out! (chuckles nervously) I'm getting a bit carried away now, aren't I? Sorry about that. Anyway, it all started last week, but I think... no, wait, was it two weeks ago? Oh dear, my mind's going blank. (pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The itching! It's been getting worse, you see. And the patches, they seem to be spreading. I've tried applying some of that ointment... what's it called? Ah yes, calamine lotion. But it only seems to help for a little while. Then the itching comes back with a vengeance! (laughs awkwardly) Vengeance, haha!

(Starts rambling again)

You know, my mother used to have something like this when she was younger. I think it was eczema or... no, wait, that's not right. Wasn't it psoriasis? No, no, I'm getting all confused now! (laughs) Oh dear, sorry about this.

(Clears throat)

Can't even scratch my arm without feeling like I'm tearing the skin off. Now, what was I saying? Ah yes, the rash. It's all over, but some places are worse than others.

They're all over my legs and arms, like a million tiny... (stammers) I mean, I think they might be itchy too. Oh, wait, I had some trouble with my stomach last week, could that be related? (pauses) No, no, focus! The bumps. Yeah, they just look like little knots under the skin.

Now, let me see... where's my tea? Ah yes, here it is. (picks up a cup of tea on the table) Anyway, I'm gettin' a bit mixed up. Can't say for sure when this started or how long I've had these symptoms. Guess it's just been lately, but what feels like ""lately""... (chuckles nervously) Excuse me!"

This rash, it's everywhere. Arms, legs, back... even on my face, just like freckles but not quite. And there are these spots, you see? My skin color's changed, a bit darker than usual. Not sure if that's from this itchiness or what... ( scratches arm ) Oh dear...

Now, I also got some lumps and knot-like pimples. They're painful to the touch, like someone stuck a needle in me... ( winces ) You know, remind me to tell you about my nephew's wedding last weekend... nice young couple, just getting married... anyway...

It started with this one spot on my arm, looked like a mosquito bite or something. I thought it'd go away, but nope... just got worse and spread out. Don't know what triggers it, maybe the heat? Or is that too much cold air? ( shrugs ) I'm getting all mixed up here...

I remember now: I went to see my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson – she's an artist, you know... and she said something about allergies being linked to skin issues...

Not quite a rash, but... well, you'll see when you take a look, doc.","I don't know if I'm remembering this right, but I think I used to get these... what do you call 'em? Ah yes, eczema or something like that when I was a kid. Anyway, my skin, it gets all itchy and bumps appear. Some of 'em turn red, others get all rough. (pauses) You know, my sister had it too. Poor thing.

And then there's these other things... pimples? Pimples don't sound right... small balls is what I mean. They show up out of nowhere, without any warning. Don't hurt or anything, but they just sit there looking like little orange marbles. (chuckles) Reminds me of my grandson's toys.

And spots. Different colors than the rest of my skin. My cousin had one of those once... or was it a mole? Wait, I'm getting all mixed up now. It's not that important. Anyway, these spots just pop up and they're always different shades. (sighs) Excuse me, what was that other thing I wanted to tell you about?

Oh yes! My skin gets itchy and bumps show up. I try to scratch 'em but it doesn't help much. Sometimes my legs get real itchy at night... or is it my feet? I swear, I used to have the worst time with these things as a kid. We didn't know what they were back then... no doctor came all the way out to our farm... (trails off)"
15,Fungal infection,"Doctor, I have these red rashes that keep popping up and my skin is continuously itching. In addition, I've observed some odd color-different spots on my skin, as well as some little nodules on my skin that appear to be expanding.","Doctor... I'm gettin' these red rashes again, and they just pop up out of nowhere. My skin's been itchin' somethin' fierce. You know, like that time my cousin had those awful poison ivy outbreaks? (pauses) Wait, what was the name of that new park we went to last year? Ah yes, Oakdale Park! (chuckles)

Anyway... these rashes, they're red and itchy. And then there's them spots on my skin... they're not just any color, if you know what I mean. Some are brown, some are pinkish-red. My granddaughter said they look like little freckles, but I'm not so sure. (pauses) Now, where did I put that picture of my great-grandfather? Ah yes, on the mantle...

And then there's them nodules... small bumps, really. They're gettin' bigger, though. I've had 'em for a while now, but they just keep growin'. I'm not sure what to make of it, doc... (trails off)","Doctor... I think you said it was time for my appointment? (pauses) Oh dear, what was it again? Ah yes, my skin... (chuckles) It's been acting up something awful. These red rashes, they just keep popping up everywhere! And the itching, oh Lord have mercy... it's driving me crazy! Can't seem to get no relief from it. I've tried putting on all sorts of creams and lotions, but nothing seems to work for long.

And then there are these other spots... different colors, you see? Like little freckles or something, but not just any old freckles... (pauses) Now what was the name of that medication... the one my sister took for her skin? Oh yes, I remember! It started with an 'E'. (laughs) Erythromycin, no that's not it... anyway, it's something like that. Ahem... Sorry, doctor.

Now where were we? Ah yes, these spots and rashes. They're getting bigger too... little nodules or something. I don't know what they are exactly. Expanding, you know? Like a balloon filling up with air! (chuckles) I'm starting to get worried about 'em now. Should I be worrying? Am I worrying unnecessarily? Lord have mercy, I wish my sister were here... she was always so smart about these things...

I hope that's all right, doctor. My mind's just a jumble of worries nowadays... You know what they say: ""You're as old as your bones."" (laughs) And mine are creaky!"
16,Fungal infection,"I have been experiencing some really intense itching all over my body, along with redness and bumps on my skin. There are also these weird patches that are different colors than the rest of my skin, and sometimes I get these nodules that look like small bumps.","Doctor... I've been having this itching, you know? Really intense itching all over my body. It's driving me crazy, if I'm being honest. And then there's the redness and bumps on my skin. (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about that time I went to the lake house last summer... my grandkids loved playing in the water. Anyway...(clears throat) these weird patches on my skin... they're different colors than the rest of it. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. (trails off) Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, the itching. And sometimes I get these nodules... small bumps. Like little volcanoes on my arm...(pauses again) Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous chicken soup...","I've been feelin' this... this itchiness, all over my body. Can't describe it no better than that. My skin's all red and blotchy, got these bumps on me too. (pauses) Now, let me think... I was at the grocery store yesterday, bought some fresh vegetables... carrots, you know? And I started thinkin' about my sister, she loves carrots too... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes! The itching. It's so... intense. Can't even scratch it right, you know? Gets worse when I'm... (pauses again) When I'm in the shower, I always remember this one time at the beach... had a sand castle contest with my kids... we made a big ol' dragon... (chuckles)

Now, where was I? Oh yes! The patches. They're different colors than the rest of me skin. Like these little islands on my arm here... and sometimes they turn red too, like the bumps. And then there are these nodules, small bumps that feel hard under your fingers. Can't recall when I first noticed 'em exactly... (hesitates) Was it during my last trip to Florida? Or was that just a different time altogether?

Um... and, oh! Sometimes the itching feels like pins and needles or something. Hard to describe, but it's real uncomfortable. Like someone's scratchin' under me skin with those little metal things they use in dentistry... (laughs) What were they called again? Oh dear, my mind's a blank...

Anyway, I thought maybe you'd know what this is... or can do something about it. Can't rightly sleep at night because of the itchiness... and these colors on me skin are gettin' on my nerves, if you know what I mean... (trails off)"
17,Fungal infection,"All over my body, I've been scratching so much that my skin has become red and developed pimples. Additionally, I occasionally get these nodules that resemble little pimples, as well as these strange patches that are a different hue from the rest of my skin.","Doc... I've been scratchin' somethin' fierce lately. My skin's all red and bumpy now. These little bumps, they're like pimples but not exactly. And then there's these other things, nodules, I think that's what you call 'em? They're a bit bigger than the others.

You know, my sister had something similar when she was younger... or was it her cousin? Ah, bother! Anyway... these patches on my skin, they're different colors. Like, not exactly darker, but just a shade off. I got one on my arm here... (taps arm) and another on my chest.

Now, where did I put that calendar? I could've sworn it was right next to the phone... Oh, yes! My appointment's tomorrow at two. Not today, no, no... I'm sure of it. These bumps, they come and go. Sometimes I get 'em in the morning, sometimes at night. (chuckles) Like my arthritis, always actin' up at the wrong times!

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! My skin. It's been like this for a while now... weeks? Months? Hmm...","I was thinkin', what was I tellin' ya about? Ah yes! My skin, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. I've been scratchin' all over, can't even explain why, just can't stop myself. And now my skin's all red and... and pimply, I suppose you'd say. Pimples everywhere. (pauses) You know, I remember when my sister had acne back in high school, she was so embarrassed about it... (trails off)

Anyway, these nodules, they keep showin' up. Little bitty things, look just like pimples but they're a mite bigger, if you can imagine that. And then there's these patches, they're just... different. Different color, I mean. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes! My skin, it's got these patches too.

Different hue, like I said. Can't quite describe it, but... (struggles for words) ...like a rash or somethin'. Don't know what causes 'em, but they're there every now and then. Like, one day I'll be walkin' down the street, minding my own business, and suddenly I'll have one of these patches on my arm. (chuckles to herself) Ah, the things that happen when you get older...

(suddenly distracted) Did I tell ya about the time... no, wait, what was it? Oh yes! My skin's been itchier than usual lately too. Must be all this pollen or dust or... something. That's probably it, right? (trails off again)"
18,Fungal infection,"I've been experiencing a lot of itching, which has been accompanied with a rash that appears to be growing worse over time. There are also certain areas of skin that are different colours from the rest, and I've spotted several lumps that resemble little nodes.","You know, doc... I'm gettin' these itches somethin' fierce. Can't sleep at night from 'em. And then there's this rash, like a big ol' patch on my arm... and it's spreadin', too. I swear, I saw it start right after I went to the family reunion last month. Or was it the one before? My sister-in-law Edna always says I get confused about dates... anyway! The rash has different colors - you know, like a bruise would be? And there's these little lumps, like nodes or somethin', under my skin. Now, where did I put that letter from the insurance company...","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right, but... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my teeth? Ah yes, here they are... So, you see, doc... or is it nurse? (chuckles) No matter, I'm sure it's all the same. Anyway, these little bumps on my skin, they started as just a bit of itchiness, but now... (pauses to collect thoughts) Now it's like my whole body's on fire! Can't even sleep at night for scratchin'. And this rash, dear me, it looks like someone took a paintbrush to my arms and legs. Different colours, all swirly and whatnot.

You see, I was talkin' to Agnes just the other day... lovely lady, by the way... (pauses) What were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, the garden! She had the most beautiful roses this time of year. (gets lost in thought for a moment)

Oh dear, right, my skin. So, there are these little lumps too. Nodes or somethin', I think you called 'em? Like tiny little mountains on my back. And they're itchin' like crazy! Doc... or nurse... (laughs) Can't remember your name... You'll get it in a minute, I'm sure.

Now where was I? Ah yes, the rash and lumps. Like I said, different colours. Red here, blue there. Don't know what to make of it myself. My husband would say I've got too much heat in my blood. (chuckles) Heat, indeed! More like a lack of oxygen in my brain... (trails off)"
19,Fungal infection,"I've been having a lot of problems with itching, and it's been accompanied by a rash that seems to be getting worse over time. There are also some patches of skin that are different colors than the rest, and I've noticed some bumps that look like little nodes.","I've been having these itching spells, you see... and my skin, it gets all red and inflamed. Can't even sit still, I swear. Reminds me of that time at the beach when I got sunburned real bad. (pauses) Ah yes, this rash, now. It's been getting worse over... um... weeks? Months? (chuckles) Time flies, don't it?

Anyway, there are these patches on my arms and legs, different colors than the rest of my skin. Some places are like... brown spots, I think. Others look like big blisters. And then there's these little bumps... nodes, I think that's what they're called? (pauses) Small as a dime, but they hurt a bit when I touch 'em.

You know, I remember my sister had something similar once... or was it my cousin? Ah, details don't matter now. Point is, this itching won't go away no matter how much cream I use...","I don't know if you remember, Doctor... I came in for that cough, last week? Yeah, I think it was Thursday... anyway... (pauses) 

So, this itching business. It started a few months ago, maybe around summer time? I'd scratch and then it would feel better for a bit, but then it comes back. And the rash! Goodness gracious, it's gotten so bad. My skin just feels like it's on fire sometimes. (chuckles to herself) Oh dear me...

I've been trying to remember if I did something that started this whole thing. You know, maybe I put on some new soap or... hmm... what was the other day? Ah yes! I went to the church sale and bought a new pillowcase. That's when I got the rash. No, wait, that can't be right... (laughs nervously) Oh dear...

The skin patches, they're like little islands of different colors now. Some are red, some are brown, and there's even one that's sort of... purple? Yeah, it looks just awful. And then I found these bumps, like little nodes or something. They feel hard when you press on them. (pauses) My sister-in-law had something similar once, but she said it was from an insect bite... or was that just her eczema acting up again?

I'm getting so confused now! Where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... here they are. Now let me think straight for a second... What's the word I want to say? (stammers and mutters)"
20,Fungal infection,"Doctor, My skin is covered in an uncomfortable rash and has a few odd patches of skin that are a different colour. There are a few pimples on my skin that resemble little knots.","""Ah, doctor... I'm so glad you're here. My skin... well, it's just been acting up somethin'. Got this rash all over me, and it's just not comfortable at all. Different colors too, like... (pauses to think) what was the name of that flower my wife used to love? The one with the white petals? Oh, doesn't matter now... anyway... there are these patches, see? And they're a different color from the rest of me skin. Now, let me think when I first noticed this... was it last week or two weeks ago? Hmm... and then there are these little bumps... (pauses to scratch) knots, that's what they look like – little knots on my face. Can't even remember how long I've been gettin' those.""","Well, you see... I was thinkin' about my garden this mornin', and my wife said I should get some more fertilizer... but anyway... my skin. It's all red and itchy, like when I got that sunburn last summer. You remember that, don't you? (pauses) Oh dear, what was the question again? Ah yes, the rash! So, it's been this way for a few weeks now. I've tried puttin' some calamine lotion on it, but... (trails off)

Now, let me think... where did I put that recipe book? My wife always says I should write down my recipes so she can make 'em too... (chuckles) But, uh, the rash! Yes. There are these spots, like little islands in the sea of red skin. They're not itchy or anythin', but they're a different color altogether. I'm pretty sure I saw one of those on my arm last night when I was gettin' ready for bed... (scratches arm) Oh, and there's also these bumps... knots, like my wife calls 'em. Yeah, that's it! Little bumps like tiny knots.

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I could swear I left 'em right here on the... (gets distracted) Do you know what we had for dinner last night? My wife made her famous chicken parmesan... Mmm... anyway... this rash. It's not too painful or anythin', but it's just so... uncomfortable. Like when my pants are a size too small, you know? (laughs) Ah, I'm gettin' all confused now!"

I've been feelin' like I'm bug bit all over, you know? Itchin' somethin' fierce, day and night. And then there's this rash, it looks like a big ol' mess. Gets worse every time I look at it, if you can believe that. My granddaughter's birthday was last weekend, and she turned 32, by the way... or is it 35? Hmm, anyway... 

There are these patches of skin, different colors from the rest of me. Some are red, some are purple, like little bruises. And then there's these lumps, like little nodes, I think they call 'em. Doctor Smith used to say that about my brother's face when he got sick with what was it... ah yes, lupus. Oh dear, don't mind me, just get on with the exam, would you?""","I'm so glad I came in today... I mean, I've been itching like crazy for weeks now. No, months? Is that right? Time flies when you're... (pauses) Ah yes! Anyway, it started with some red bumps on my arm, and then more showed up on my legs. They look like little nodes, if you ask me. And the itching, oh boy! I scratch all day long. My poor skin's all raw and whatnot.

Now, where was I? (chuckles) Oh yes, the rash! It's not just red bumps; there are patches of different colours too. Like one spot on my back is a funny shade of brown... or is it green? Hmm, might be both! (laughs) My mind's gone blank sometimes.

You know what they say: ""age comes with wrinkles"" – but I'm talking about these bumps and lumps. They're like little blemishes, all over the place! Can't even sleep at night without itching some more... Ah, my poor backside! (laughs)

Now let me think on this for a sec... wasn't there something else? Oh yes! My Aunt Edna used to get these skin things too. No, wait – it was her cousin! Or maybe her friend's sister... (stammers) Ugh, I forget. Anyway, she said she took some cream or ointment or something, and the rash went away. So that must be what you'll prescribe me, right?"

Lots of 'em. And these little patches, they're not like my skin at all. Different color, you know? Like, um, what's that thing called when your skin goes dark in one spot? (pauses again) Ah, yes! Vitiligo or... or something. Doesn't matter now. The point is, I have these lumps too. (hesitates) Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Oh dear...

No, no, they're quite... peculiar. Different colors than my normal skin tone. (chuckles) Now, let me see if I can remember where I put that... tea... yes, the tea. My wife always says I leave things lying around. Ah, focus! Yes, these patches on my skin, some of them are red, others are brown... I think.

Now, what was I saying? Oh right. The lumps or bumps. Can't even recall when they started. Don't know if it's connected to the itchiness and rashes or not. (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden this spring? Beautiful tomatoes I grew myself! Anyway... yes, these lumps are quite noticeable now. Not painful, no, but rather annoying. (hesitates) Wait a minute, did we have trouble with my skin before when I was younger? My mother-in-law always said something about me having eczema as a child... or was it my brother? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, getting old's not for the faint of heart! What was I saying again? Ah yes, the bumps. Just hope I can figure out what's causing all this commotion on my skin."

So, there are these spots, dischromic spots, I think the nurse said? And little lumps too. Like acne, but not really. More like bumps. They're everywhere now. Even on my back and legs. And it's so... so itchy! I scratch and scratch, but it just won't stop. (pauses again) I wonder if that new medicine I'm taking is causing it? Or maybe it's just my allergies acting up again...""","I... I've been feelin' so poorly lately, doc. This rash, you see... (pauses) It started with my back, and then it just spread like wildfire. Everywhere! My arms, legs, even my face. Can't believe how fast it came on. And the itching, oh boy... (chuckles awkwardly) Makes me want to scratch myself half to death.

And these little lumps? Discoloration spots? I'm pretty sure that's what they are. Look like freckles or something, but not quite right. (trails off) You know, I had a cousin who used to get those spots all the time... poor thing was always complaining about them. Course, she was an older gal, too... (giggles) Ah, anyway...

I don't know what's causing it, if you can tell me that. Must be somethin' I ate or something in my environment, you'd think. All this new construction on our street, maybe it's the dust or pollution? No, no, wait... (laughs nervously) Oh dear, just remember when we used to have those big ol' trees on 5th Street, and how the sun would shine through their leaves like a big ol' filter... 

Freckles! That's what I said. Dischromic spots... or something. Ugh, it's driving me mad! (stammers) This is really makin' me lose sleep, if you can imagine... My grandma used to say that when the skin started gettin', that was a sign of... uh, what was it again? Oh yes, age! (chuckles weakly) Guess I'm just gettin' old, huh?"

No, wait, wasn't it measles? Ah dear, I always get those two mixed up.

Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, the itching. It's so irritating! I mean, I know I should be grateful for my health, but this... ugh. Sometimes these red spots turn a different color, not just red, like, pink or brown or something. And sometimes they get all scaly and rough. Now, what was it that doctor said about dry skin? Ah yes, moisturize! I remember now, that's the key.

You know, my sister had terrible skin problems when she was younger... Poor dear, always breaking out in hives. No, not hives, that's different... Ugh, I'm getting all confused again. Oh well.

Red and bumpy areas... (pauses) Now, where did I put those glasses? Ah yes, red and bumpy... like eczema or somethin'. Can't remember if it was eczema or psoriasis... one of them things. And these patches on my skin... different color than the rest, you see. It's like when I used to help Edna with her garden. We had this one plant, wasn't a flower, but it had those colorful spots all over it... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! These patches. They're itchy too.

Now, these little bumps... (pauses again) Are they like warts? No, no, not warts. Those are just... I don't know, hard things on the skin. And this itchiness... it's like when I had that rash after eatin' that spicy soup last winter. Spicy soup! Good grief, what was I makin'? (laughs) Ah yes, the itchiness. Been goin' on for a week or two now. Prolly longer, but my calendar's all jumbled up... you know how it is.

Anyway, I've also had some of those little balls... pimples? Is that right? Yeah, like little balls. They're like zits, but bigger. And the itchiness gets worse when it rains... (pauses once more) Rain! Good heavens, I think it's time for my pills. What was I sayin'?"
28,Fungal infection,"I've been having this really annoying itch all over my body, and I have red and bumpy spots on my skin too. There are also some areas that are a different color than the rest of my skin, and I've had some bumps that look like little balls.","You know, doc, I've been having this itch, it's like... (pauses) Oh, what was that commercial we saw last week on TV? You know, with the nice lady and her garden? (chuckles) Anyway... This itch is driving me crazy! It started a while back, I think. Maybe last month? No, wait, wasn't it longer than that? Um...

And these bumps! They're all over my body. Red, bumpy spots. Some of them are raised like little balls. (pauses) Did we ever finish watching that John Wayne movie on TV Land? I swear, every time we'd watch a show, the VCR would tape over it... Ah, never mind.

Some areas of my skin, they're just different, you know? Not just red or bumpy. I don't know what to call 'em. (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now!","Oh dear, doc... I mean, I've been having this itch all over my body, you know? It's so annoying. Can't even sleep at night, scratchin' and scratchin'. And then there's these red spots, bumpy ones too. Some of 'em are bigger than others, like that one on my arm... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing last week? Caught a big ol' bass, but it got away from me.

Anyway... (sighs) Where was I? Ah yes, the bumps. They look like little balls, like those golf balls my husband used to play with. He'd hit 'em into the woods and they'd roll around, all over the place. You know how that is?

Now, let me think... (pauses) What's that thing called when your skin changes color? (taps foot) Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue... Um, hyper-what-now? Ah yes, hyperpigmentation! That's it.

Some areas are darker than others, and I've got these little bumps too. They're not painful or anything, just itchy. Like when you have a mosquito bite that drives you crazy. You know how that is, right? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up...

You see, doc... (pauses, lost in thought) Wait, what was the question again?"
29,Fungal infection,"I've had a pretty uncomfortable itch all over my body, as well as red and bumpy areas on my skin. There are also certain patches of my epidermis with a distinct shade than the rest of it, and I've had some pimples that resemble little balls.","I'm so glad you're here, Doc. I've been having this itch, you know, all over my body. It's just... (pauses) You know how we went to the farmers' market last week? Oh dear, what was that nice lady's name who sold the preserves? Anyway, it's like ants crawling under my skin. Red and bumpy areas too. I was watching a show on TV... ""Downton Abbey"", is it? Ah yes, and they had all those lovely gardens, just... (chuckles) But anyway, these patches on my skin, some of them are darker than the rest. Like freckles, but not quite. And then there are these little balls... pimple-like things. What's that thing called when your skin gets like that? (pauses again) It's been going on for weeks now, I think... or is it months?","I don't know if I should say this, but... (pauses) ...my skin's been acting up somethin'. Itchiness all over, ya see? Like my whole body's got a bad case of the hives or somethin'. Red and bumpy patches too. And some areas are just ashy gray now, not like they used to be. My wife said it was 'cause I didn't wear sunscreen last summer... (chuckles) Oh boy, she's always on my case about somethin'.

Now, them red bumps? They're like little volcanoes. (pauses) Or maybe it's the chicken pox from when I was a kid. No, wait, that was before we moved to the country. I had that really bad case of poison ivy once... (trails off) Anyway...

And then there are these pimples. Little balls of white stuff on my face and neck. Not like acne, exactly. More like... more like when you get a pimple and it just doesn't wanna heal, ya know? My friend Ed had somethin' like that once, but it was inside his mouth... (laughs) Ah, silly me.

Oh boy, I'm talkin' too much now. I think I might've taken some of them newfangled pain relievers for my sciatica last week. Could this be a side effect or somethin'? (pauses again) Oh dear, what's the name of that other thing... You know, like when your skin gets all dry and flaky? That's what it feels like now...

Anyway, I just wanted to mention it. Hope you can do somethin' about it..."

Can't even remember the last time I wore a dress without gettin' comments on 'em. My sister-in-law came over for dinner and she said they looked like... uh, what was it she said? Ah yes, like I'd gotten into some sort of, you know, plant sap or somethin'. Anyway... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time my grandkids visited and they spilled paint all over the carpet? Oh dear me, I'm gettin' sidetracked... those rashy spots are on my arms, legs, even face. Some areas look kinda darker than the rest of my skin, and then there's these bumps that are hard to the touch.

Itchy, you see? All over the place. Can't even scratch myself in peace without thinkin' about all these things to do today... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, itchy.

Now, there are these rashy spots everywhere. (pauses) I could've sworn I saw a recipe for chicken soup on that magazine... anyway, the rashy spots. They're not too big, but they're all over my arms, legs, back... you name it. And then there's this other business – some areas of my skin look different in shade than the rest. Not quite sure what I mean by that, but I'm sure it's important. (chuckles) Reminds me of when I used to garden...

And the bumps! Oh boy, they're... (hesitates) hard? Is that the word? Hardish. Some are a bit soft too, but most of 'em are just solid. Like little lumps. Don't feel right at all. Now, let me think for a sec – what was I fixin' to do today? (pauses) Ah yes, the doctor! That's why I'm here... (laughs)

Now where did I put my glasses? Always losin' those things... anyway, like I said, these bumps and rashy spots. Don't know if they're related or whatnot. My skin just seems so... dry lately. You know what'd be nice right now? A nice warm bath... (trails off)"

Had 'em for weeks now, I think? Started with just my arms and legs, but now they're all over. And those rashy patches, oh dear... they're all different shapes and sizes. Some of 'em are darker than the rest of my skin, you know, like freckles but not freckles. (chuckles) Reminds me of my cousin Edna's moles on her back. I always thought she was a bit too fond of sunbathing... Anyway, these lumps, they're firm to the touch, like little bumps under the skin. Now what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, the itchiness...","I don't know what's going on with me... been feelin' quite itchy, y'know? Can't seem to shake this itchiness off no matter how much I scratch. Rashes all over my skin, everywhere. Don't remember when it started exactly... was it last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Hmm... anyway, these rashy patches, they come and go, don't seem to be gettin' any better.

Now, there's somethin' else too... (pauses) You know that old house I used to live in on Elm Street? We had a big ol' oak tree right outside our window... (chuckles) Used to climb it all the time when I was young. Where was I? Ah yes, my skin! There's these darker patches too. Not just any ordinary color, no sir. They're like, a deeper brown or somethin'. And then there are some firm lumps... don't know what those are exactly either... (laughs) My wife used to make me those nice little buns for breakfast... (pauses again)

Anyway, these lumps. Yeah, they're like, under my skin or somethin', feel like hard little rocks. Don't hurt nothin' but just feel funny. And the itchiness? Lord have mercy... drives me crazy at night when I'm tryin' to sleep. (pauses once more) Now what was I sayin'? Oh yeah!

Some of 'em are darker than the rest, almost like bruises, but they don't hurt there. No... no, it's these other lumps that are painful. (pauses) Now what was I making for dinner last night? Oh right, chicken soup... (trails off) Where was I? Ah yes, these lumps. They're on my arms, legs, and back – everywhere! Can't even walk without wincing in pain...""","I'm not sure if I should be telling you this, but... (pauses) Oh, you know what?

And these blotches... well, I don't know what you'd call 'em exactly... they're not just red, no sirree, some of 'em are darker than usual. (pauses to think) You see, when I was younger... I used to have a friend who had a similar condition, but it turned out she was allergic to something in the garden... (chuckles)

Rashy blotches, that's what you called it? Yes, yes, exactly! They're all over my skin now. Arms, legs, torso... even on my face, good grief! And then there are these lumps... oh boy, they hurt like a sore tooth when I press 'em. My wife says they look like those bumps we used to get from eating too much cabbage... (laughs) But she's always been one for old wives' tales...

Now what was it you said about medication? No, no, don't bother with that just now... I think I remember something about my sister... (pauses, lost in thought)"

And let me think... what was the other thing? Ah yes! Some of my skin is a mite darker than the rest, like it's sunburned or somethin'. My cousin Edna had that same problem last summer, but she said it went away on its own.

Ah yes, this rash business... (pauses) Now, let me see if I can recall when it started... hmmm... must've been last week or the week before that... (chuckles) Time just slips right on by, don't it?

Anyway, like I said, got these rashes and pimples all over. Don't know what to make of 'em, but I reckon you'll figure somethin' out.","Oh dearie me... *ahem*... I've been scratchin' myself somethin' fierce lately. Can't seem to stop. My skin's all broke out in those rashy places, you know? Like hives or somethin'.

(chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all muddled.

Anyway, these pimples are firm, not soft like most of 'em. And they're on my face, neck, arms... wherever it is you folks call the spot just above the elbow? (laughs) You know what I mean! It's a funny place for bumps to pop up, ain't it?

And them brown spots... (pauses again) Now, I'm gettin' myself all worked up thinkin' about this. We used to have a little old lady in our neighborhood who was always sayin' how the sun was bad for your skin. She'd cover herself up like a... well, like a little old lady! (laughs)

But anyway, these brown spots are all different shades than my regular skin tone. Some of 'em look sorta yellowish, others reddish-brown... I don't rightly know what to call it. (trails off) Oh dearie me, this scratchin' business is gettin' on my nerves somethin' fierce..."

I'm not sure how long they've been here, time flies when you're watching TV, doesn't it? (pauses) Oh dear, what's that program called? You know, the one with the nice young lady who solves mysteries... um... (sighs)

These patches, they're a bit hard to the touch. Like little bumps or something. And they hurt sometimes when I scratch them. My goodness, I hope I don't have that skin cancer business.

Like when I used to get poison ivy out in the garden. That was a mess, let me tell you. (chuckles)

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my skin. There are these spots, you know, and they're all... rashy. Is that the word? Rashy? Like when I got that chickenpox as a kid... I had it real bad... or was it measles? (laughs) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up sometimes...

So anyway, there are these spots, and then some of them look different in color, you see. Not like my normal skin, no sir. That's the one thing that really gets to me. I mean, I know what normal skin looks like... or should I say, what it used to look like? (laughs) Ah ha! Age, right?

And then there are these bumps, hard bumps. Like when you get a bruise, but not a bruise exactly... Hard bumps. Yeah, that's the best way I can describe 'em. (pauses, lost in thought)

Anyway, these bumps... they're firm, like little pebbles under my skin. And some areas, they're all dark and blotchy. My goodness gracious, it's just... unpleasant. Extremely unpleasant, as I said. Like someone took a rough sponge to me. (chuckles nervously) Oh dear...

You know, my sister used to have this problem with her eczema when she was younger. Always complainin' about the itching. But hers wasn't like mine, I don't think... Was it itchy too? Hmm... now that I think about it, I'm gettin' a bit mixed up.

My arms, legs, even my face. I was out in the garden yesterday, and I must've gotten into some kinda bug's nest or somethin'. Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""What about them rashes?"" Well, doc... They're like little red blisters. Some of 'em are raised up like welts. And then there's these other spots... Not the same color as my skin no more. (pauses) I remember when my grandkids used to get those sunburns at the beach. Reminded me of them, but, uh...

And let me tell you about these bumps... Painful! Like someone's stickin' a needle in my side or somethin'. Don't know if it's related, but I've been gettin' this funny feelin' in my joints lately too. (chuckles) Oh boy, now where'd I put them aspirins? Ah yes, the bumps! Some are hard to touch, and others are soft... All over my body, mind you. I even got one right here on my earlobe. Now, don't think I'm gettin' all sorts of diseases or anythin', but... (stammers) You see what I mean?

Now, where was I? Ah yes! That rashy business. It started a few weeks ago, after the storm went through our neighborhood. My neighbor's kid said they saw some kinda snakes slitherin' around... (mutters to self) Snakes in my garden! Must've been some sorta allergic reaction, don't you think?"
41,Fungal infection,"Recently, I've been itching myself a lot, and my skin is covered with rashy patches. Furthermore, there are a few regions where my skin doesn't appear to be its usual tone, and I've experienced a few lumps that are exceptionally painful.","Well, doc... (pauses) You know, I've been itching myself something awful lately. Can't seem to stop scratchin'. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time my granddaughter was itchin' like a flea-ridden dog, Lord have mercy... (clears throat) Ah yes, the rashy patches. They're all over, doc. My arms, legs, even my poor back's got 'em. And there's these other places where my skin just don't look right no more. It's all pale and... (pauses, searching for words) Well, I think it's lighter than usual, if you know what I mean. And then there's them lumps. Oh boy, them lumps are killin' me! They're so painful, doc. I swear, I've been gettin' 'em for... (pauses again) Shoot, now I'm tryin' to remember how long it's been. Must've been a week or two? Maybe three? Time sure flies when you're havin' fun... (trails off)","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I've been having the most dreadful itching sensation on my skin, can't rightly say how long now... (chuckles) Let me think, was it last week? Or was it last month? Oh dear, my mind's a jumble these days. Anyway, it started with this awful itching, couldn't sleep at night from it. And then I looked in the mirror and oh boy... (pauses again)

My skin's all covered with these rashy patches now. I don't know what to call 'em, but they're just so... so... (struggles for words) you know, red and itchy and just plain annoying! And then there are these other areas where my skin doesn't seem right. Not its usual tone, if you know what I mean. It's like... have I told you about the time I went to Hawaii? Oh dear, we had the most wonderful vacation... (trails off)

And then there are these lumps on me now. They're just awful, so painful! I was thinking maybe I should get one of those creams from my granddaughter? She's been using some sort of cream for her eczema and it seems to be working quite well. (pauses) Now where did I put that recipe book... Oh yes, the lumps. They're just so tender and sore. I'm not sure what's causing 'em, but they're driving me plumb crazy! (chuckles)

Oh dear, my brain's going in circles now. Where was I? Ah yes, my skin. Just thought I'd mention it to you, Doctor... or is it Nurse? Oh, doesn't matter! (laughs)"
42,Fungal infection,"I've been having this constant itch and there are these red and bumpy spots on my skin. There are also some patches that are a different color than the rest of my skin, and I've had some bumps that are kind of like little lumps.","Let me tell you about this... (pauses) Oh dear, I was just making myself some tea earlier and I remembered that time my sister Edna came over for dinner and she made us those lovely sugar cookies... anyway...(chuckles)

I've been having this constant itch, it's like sandpaper on my skin. Can't even sleep at night because of it. And then there are these red and bumpy spots... I think they started about a week ago? Could be longer, I don't know, time just flies when you're watching TV, doesn't it? (laughs)

And these other patches, dear me, they're a different color altogether. Like little islands on my skin or something. And then there are some bumps... little lumps, that's the only way to describe them. Like I said, can't even sleep with this itch...","Doc... I don't know if you'll believe me... or anything anymore. Anyway, this itch, it won't go away. Like, at first I thought it was just my age catchin' up with me, but no... it's been months now. Months! And them spots, red and bumpy like, they're everywhere. I mean, not everywhere, but on my arms, legs, back... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I visited my cousin in Arizona? Beautiful desert sunsets...

Um... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the spots! Some of 'em are scaly, some of 'em aren't. And then there's these patches... they're a different color than the rest of me skin. (pauses) You know, I swear I had that same exact couch when I was a young girl. My grandmother used to sit on it and... (trails off)

Oh, right! The lumps! Yeah, some days there are little bumps all over my body. Little lumps. Not exactly sure what those are. Could be psoriasis or eczema or... or something else entirely. I just know it's driving me crazy! (chuckles) Like when I used to drive my husband to work in the morning...

Anyway, like I said, this has been goin' on for months now. And I've had some new... uh, what was it called? Ah yes! Some new skin tags too. Little flappy things hangin' off me neck and stuff. (giggles) Reminds me of that time at the beach when I caught a sunburn so bad... (gets lost in thought)

Now where were we? Oh yeah, this itch! It's like it's trying to tell me somethin', but what?"
43,Fungal infection,"There are red, bumpy areas on my skin, and I've been scratching myself nonstop. Additionally, I have some bumps that resemble little lumps and some spots that are a different shade of skin than the rest of my body.","I've been gettin' these red, bumpy areas on my skin, and Lord have mercy, I've been scratchin' myself somethin' fierce. My granddaughter came over last week, and she was makin' me watch that new TV show with the young folks in it... you know, the one with the robots? Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, these bumps. They're all over my arms, legs... even on my back. And then there are them little lumps, like small potatoes or somethin'. I've had 'em for a while now, but they just seem to be gettin' worse. And the spots... well, they're just different shades of skin, I reckon. Not sure how long it's been goin' on, but my husband says it's been months? Could be years, though... time gets away from me somethin' awful...","I don't know if you'll believe me, but I've been... um... getting these little red bumps everywhere. On my arms, legs, back... can't even count 'em all. And they itch like crazy! Can't stop scratchin' myself raw. (pauses) Oh boy, that reminds me of when I was a kid and we'd go to the beach for summer vacation... sunburns, oh those were a real treat...

Anyway, back to these bumps... they're not just on my skin, but under it too. You see, I've been gettin' these little lumps, like small peas or somethin', where there's no bumps at all. (laughs) Sounds silly now that I think about it. Must be the heat, that's what it is... too much heat.

And then there are these spots... you know, they're a different color than my skin? Can't say exactly what color, but darker or lighter... like I had a sunburn once in '52 and it took weeks to fade out. (pauses) Wasn't that summer we went on a camping trip with the family? Good times...

Uh-what was I sayin'? Ah yes! These spots! They're scattered around my body, everywhere... (chuckles nervously) Guess I must've gotten some sort of rash or somethin'. Must get it checked out, don't want it spreadin' nothin' or gettin' infected. Always better to be safe than sorry, right?"
44,Fungal infection,"I've had a lot of itching on my skin, which occasionally turns into a rash. There are also some odd patches of skin that are a different hue than the rest of me, and I occasionally get little pimples that resemble nodules.","I've been havin' this... uh, itching on my skin for a while now. Can't remember exactly how long, but I think it started when I was at Edna's house for dinner last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Oh dear, time just slips right through my fingers these days. Anyway, the itching gets pretty bad sometimes and then it turns into this... rash business. And then there's these patches of skin that are just a little darker than the rest of me. You know, like when you're out in the sun too long? Yeah, I think that's what it is. Except my grandkids say I'm always saying I'm going outside to water the plants... (chuckles) 

Oh, and then there are these little pimples that look like nodules. I don't know if I should be worried about 'em or not. My friend Mabel had those once, but she said they went away on their own.","You know, I've been havin' this...this itchiness on my skin, dear doctor. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I think it was after that trip to the beach last summer? The sun must've gotten to me or somethin'. (pauses) Anyway, it's just this constant scratchin', like someone's rubbin' a piece of sandpaper on me all night long. And then sometimes, those patches on my skin...they turn into rashes! Oh boy, I don't know what's goin' on with that.

I remember seein' some pictures in a magazine once about...about skin conditions? Was it called psoriasis or somethin'? No, no, that can't be right. (chuckles) My sister-in-law had it, and she just had to live with it all her life...or was it my cousin's wife? Anyway, I'm gettin' some discoloration on my skin now. These patches are just a different color than the rest of me. Like someone took a paintbrush and...and what's that word I want to use? Oh yeah! And splattered some gray all over!

And them little pimples, too! (exhales) They're like tiny little bumps, not really pimples, but they hurt when I press on 'em. Nodules, is that the word? My friend's son had something with nodules...or was it just warts? Ugh, my mind's gettin' all mixed up! (laughs) Anyway, doctor, you're gonna know what to do, right? You've seen this sorta thing before."
45,Fungal infection,"I've had a tendency of itching on my skin, that frequently turns into a rash. There are also some strange patches of skin that are a different tone than the rest of my skin, and I regularly get little lumps that mimic nodules.","I've had this... this itching on my skin, it comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it feels like ants crawling under my skin, and then it turns into these rashes. And I swear, doc, it started after that time I went to visit my cousin in Florida... (pauses) Ah yes, the sun! We must've stayed out too long.

Anyway, there's also these patches of skin that are lighter than the rest... or darker, I always get those two mixed up. (chuckles) Like when you burn yourself on the stove and it gets all red? Yeah, like that. And then there's these little lumps... I think they're called nodules? No, that's not right. Ah yes! Nodules, but sometimes they come out of nowhere, no warning at all.","I've been having this... um, trouble with my skin, you see. Itching, it is. Can't rightly put a finger on when it started. Might've been after I went down south for my sister's wedding last summer. Or was that the year before? Ah, yes, the food! My goodness gracious, they served me those little pastry things with cheese inside... I digress.

Anyway, this itching business. It starts as a tingling sensation on my arms or legs. Can't always pinpoint where it begins. Sometimes it's like ants crawling under my skin, other times it's more of a burning feeling. And then, out of nowhere, a rash appears! Red and scratchy, just the worst. I swear, my grandmother used to get those red patches on her hands when she'd help with the gardening.

Now, about these... irregularities. Patches of skin that aren't quite... right. Different tone, you see. Some people have freckles or moles, but not like this. No, no, these are more like little islands on my skin. And them lumps! Bumpers, I suppose they're called? Little nubs that show up here and there. Can't even recall if it's been a week or two since the last one appeared... (pauses) Did I mention the doctor told me to stop eating so much sugar? Don't know if it's related, but my teeth have been acting up something awful..."
46,Fungal infection,"I've been experiencing a lot of itching on my skin, and sometimes it turns into a rash. There are also some strange patches of skin that are a different color than the rest of me, and sometimes I get little bumps that look like nodules.","You know, doc, I've been feelin' this itchiness on my skin for... well, I think it started a few months ago? Or was it last year? Shoot, time sure flies when you're old! (chuckles) Anyway, it's been gettin' worse. Sometimes it turns into these rashes, and let me tell ya, they can be right painful. And then there are these patches of skin that are just... well, not like the rest of me. Different color, yeah? Like when I was younger, my cousin Edna used to get these freckles on her nose, same thing! (pauses) Oh, and them little bumps, they look like nodules or somethin'. Been seein' those for a bit now too... (trails off)","I'm tellin' ya, Doc... I've been feelin' this itchiness all over my body... can't explain it, but it's like someone's crawlin' under my skin. Sometimes it gets so bad I wake up in the middle of the night thinkin', ""What's goin' on?"" And then there's these rashes that come outta nowhere... not just any rashes, mind you... these are big and red and they hurt somethin' fierce.

I remember my cousin Edna had something like this when she was younger... or was it my aunt? Hmm, doesn't matter now. Anyway, I've got these patches on my arms, neck, and back... they're all different shades of brown and gray. Look just like the skin on a walnut. (chuckles) You know how walnuts are, right?

And then there's the nodules... little bumps that come up outta nowhere. My nephew said it was eczema, but I'm not so sure. Never been one for books, if you know what I mean. Anyway, these bumps don't just go away... they linger, like a cold or somethin'. (pauses) What's that stuff called? You know, when your skin gets all dry and cracks? Ah yes! Xeroderma... no, wait, that's not it.

I swear, I've been takin' my vitamins every day... got my probiotics, too. Maybe it's the pollen count or somethin'? I heard some folks have allergies now... (trails off) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, these bumps and rashes! Don't know what to make of 'em... You're the doctor, you figure it out!"

Can't remember which one I saw first, but I think it was that time I went to the beach in June... or was it July? Anyway... (pauses) I've been takin' my calcium like I should, so I don't know why this is happenin'. And now there's these lumps. Pimples, they look like. My sister had 'em when she was a teenager...

Can't stop scratchin', it's like my skin's on fire! Red spots everywhere... (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I went to the lake and got a bad case of poison ivy. But this is different, see? These spots, they're not just little red bumps, no sirree. Some of 'em are darker than others, like I've got freckles or somethin'. (pauses) Now, let me think... what was the name of that doctor my sister saw for her skin condition? Dr. Smith, maybe? No, that's not it... (sighs)

Anyway, besides these red spots, there are these lumps... pimples, I guess you'd call 'em. But they don't feel like regular pimples. They're hard and sore to the touch. And they're all over my arms, legs, face... (pauses, looking around the room) You know, I think I might've left a pot of soup on the stove at home. Wonder if it's still good... (trails off)

Oh, right! My skin! It's just been actin' up somethin' awful, Doc. Can't you do somethin' about it? Maybe give me some cream or somethin'? I don't know what's causin' all this, but I'm gettin' a might desperate here... (trails off again) You know, my grandmother used to have skin problems when she was older. She'd put these little poultices on her face and they'd clear up in no time... (pauses, lost in thought)"

Can't rightly describe it, but it's... red. And hot. Like a burn. No, not a burn, of course... my skin don't hurt like a burn would.

Now, I've got these spots on me that are all... blotchy. Different color than the rest of me. (trails off) I think I mentioned this to Dr... um... you know, last week or was it two weeks ago?

And then sometimes it gets all red and splotchy... That rash business. You know how it is.

I think it started after I went to visit my sister in Florida last winter. The humidity, maybe? Or was that just my allergies actin' up again? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' ahead of myself. So, the skin stuff... Yeah, there are these patches that are a different color than the rest of me. Like when you get too much sun, but not like that exactly... (pauses to think)

And then there's these little bumps... Nodules, is what I think they're called? They pop up now and then, like tiny little volcanoes on my skin. (laughs) My granddaughter said they looked like little mountains! Lord have mercy, that child can make me laugh even when I'm feelin' poorly.

Now, where did I put those pictures of my trip to Europe...? Ah yes, the Eiffel Tower... That reminds me, we had a lovely dinner cruise on the Seine. (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again? Oh right! My skin's been actin' up something awful. (sighs) I just hope it doesn't get any worse..."

They just showed up a few days ago, all over my arms and legs and torso. Some of 'em are even darker than my skin now. And these lumps or bumps...

I think it's this itching again, honey. Been driving me crazy for weeks now. My skin's all red, like roses, but not in a good way, you know? (pauses) Where did I put that tea kettle? Ah yes... the itching. It started on my arms and legs, but now it's everywhere: back, chest, even my face! (chuckles) Like a rash or something.

Now, I've noticed some of those red patches are getting lighter or darker than my natural skin tone. Not sure what to make of that. And have you ever had one of them... um... those things? You know, where your skin gets all bumpy like a pimple but not really a pimple? (laughs) I'm getting old, I forget what they're called!

And these lumps or bumps, whatever they are, started showing up on my arms and legs too. Some of them feel hard like... well, like bones almost! Others feel soft like cheese, (giggles) which isn't very comfortable. My sister had something similar once, but I don't remember what it was called... oh yes! Acne! No, wait, that's not right...

I've been scratching so much my skin is all flaky and dry now. Can't stop myself; it just feels like a million ants crawling under my skin.

Oh yeah, my joints! It's like someone's hammerin' away at 'em with a sledgehammer. And this rash...oh boy, it's all over me! I look like a big ol' red polka dot! (chuckles nervously) My wife says I'm gettin' a little too old for that kind of nonsense.

You know what they say, ""Aging is just wear and tear on the body."" I think I've been doin' some extra wear and tear myself. (pauses to collect thoughts) What was I talkin' about again? Oh yeah! This rash! It's itchin' somethin' fierce! Like someone's puttin' nails in my skin or somethin'!

I remember when I used to go fishin' with the boys, and we'd get these big ol' blisters on our hands. (pauses, lost in thought) Was that before or after...? Never mind! The point is, this rash is killin' me! And don't even get me started on my joints! I feel like an old broken toy, can't move no more!

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the red spots on my arms. They're just little patches of... well, I think they're some kind of rash or something. Don't quote me on that, but my sister had something similar when she came down with that virus last year... (pauses) What's that called, you know? Oh dear, it starts with an M... anyway...

Anyway, Doc, as I was saying, these chills and back pains have been going on for... um... well, let me see... (taps fingers on armrest) Must be a week or two now. No, wait, is it three weeks?

Oh, right! The red spots. They're all over my arms, like freckles or somethin'. My granddaughter said they looked like... (pauses, struggling to remember) You know what she said? That's the thing, dear, I just can't recall what she said exactly... Must've been something nice, though.

My joints and back... shoot me now, where's the coffee I had this mornin'? Ah yes, my joints and back, they ache somethin' fierce all day long. Can't walk without wincin' anymore. What's the date today, by the way? Wasn't it...","I've been feelin' just terrible lately... (pauses) You know, I was thinkin', we shoulda had that new roof put on last summer... (trails off) Oh, right! The vomiting. Yeah, it's been goin' on for a while now. Can't keep nothin' down, if you know what I mean... (chuckles)

Frequently, like three times a day, sometimes more... (pauses to think) Now where'd I put my glasses? Ah yes! And I've lost my appetite completely. Don't want nothin', even water's too much for me... (mumbles to self) Like that time I got food poisoning from that restaurant downtown...

And the pain... oh boy, it's been a real nuisance. Joints and back all the time... (pauses, seems to recall something else) You know, my sister had trouble with her joints too. Something about rheumatism... (gets confused) Wait, no, wasn't it arthritis? Ah well, doesn't matter now...

It's just been a real struggle lately... (hesitates) Did I tell you about the time we took that trip to Florida? Beautiful place... (trails off again) Oh yes! The vomiting. It's like my stomach's just... (struggles for words) You know, it's like it's in knots or somethin'...

I don't know if it's related, but I've been feelin' a bit lightheaded too... (pauses, looks around the room) Now where'd I put my purse?"
254,Dengue,I have a high fever accompanied with severe headache and body pain. I experince chills every night. There is a distinct pain behind my eyes too.,"Oh dear... high fever, you see... it's been going on for... well, let me think... is it three days now? Or was it four? Ah, but what's the point of that, anyway! (chuckles) I've had it since... Tuesday? Wednesday? Wait, no, that can't be right. 

Anyway, this fever, it's been quite something. I get these chills every night, like my whole body is shakin'. And then there's the headache... good Lord, it's like a knife through my skull! I've got pain all over, my back, arms, legs... you name it. And this morning, I woke up with this terrible ache behind my eyes... (pauses) Oh, I remember now! We had that nice dinner at Joe's last night... no, wait, was it Bob's? Never mind. This eye pain, though... it's like someone's squeezing a lemon right in there.","I... uh... I think I got a fever again. Oh dear, my head is just pounding, you know? It's like someone's hitting me with a hammer all night long. And my body, it hurts all over. My poor back, it's been acting up something fierce lately. (pauses to collect thoughts)

Anyway, the fever... yes, it's high. Must be one of those 102 thingamajigs. I don't know how to say that right. (chuckles) Oh, and chills! Every night, like clockwork. It's so... so annoying. Can't sleep a wink with this shivering business going on.

Now, let me think... what else? Ah yes, the pain behind my eyes. That's a new one, isn't it, doc? (laughs) No, no, I'm serious! There's just this dull ache all the time. Like someone stuck an ice pick in my brain or something. (trails off)

Mm... what were we talking about again? Oh right, the fever and headache. (clears throat) Sorry, dear doctor. Just need to get some rest, I suppose. Not sure if it's just a cold or one of those other things... you know, like flu or whatever. My friend Edna had something similar last year. (pauses) Wait, what was that thing called? You know, the sickness where your joints ache all over? Arthritis! That's it!

Anyway... (sighs) Yes, that's right. The pain behind my eyes. Don't like that one bit. Now I'm thinking about when I went to the doctor last time and... uh... what was I saying?"
255,Dengue,"I have been feeling extremely tired and fatigued, and I have no energy to do anything. I have developed rashes on my neck, which itch upon touching. ","You know, Doc... I've been feeling just as drained as that new dishwasher we got at our place last week, you know? I mean, it takes forever to do its job, and then it breaks down again. (pauses) Oh, dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my energy levels... or lack thereof. It's like I've been carrying around a heavy bag of groceries all day. No matter how much rest I get, I'm just as tired. And those rashes on my neck... Lord have mercy... they itch something awful when I touch 'em. Wait, is it Monday? Or Tuesday? (chuckles) Oh dear, getting old's doing that to me! Anyway, the rashes... yeah.","I'm so tired, doctor... can't even get out of bed in the morning. (pauses) You know, I was thinking about my grandson's birthday party last week... he's getting so big now... and I said to his mom, ""You're such a wonderful mother,"" you know? And she smiled and said... (trails off)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the tiredness. It's been like this for weeks now. No energy to do anything. Even simple things like taking a walk or watching TV seem like too much effort. (pauses) Did I tell you about my neighbor's garden? He grows the most wonderful tomatoes... always brings me some when they're in season...

Now, let me think back on this rash thing... (hesitates) It started on my neck, but now it seems to be spreading a bit. Itches like crazy when I touch it. My daughter said something about a sunburn, but that doesn't make sense because... (pauses) Oh dear, what's the name of that other doctor I saw last year? The one with the kind face and white coat?

Oh yes, my rash! Like I was saying, it's really bothering me now. And these fatigue spells... sometimes I just want to lie down in the middle of the day. My husband says... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe for chicken soup? Ah yes, he says it's probably because I'm getting older and need more rest... but I'm not old yet! (laughs)

Anyway, as I was saying, I think there might be something wrong with me. This fatigue and the rash don't feel right. Can you take a look at me, doctor? (trails off)"
256,Dengue,I have been experiencing a severe headache that is accompanied by pain behind my eyes. I have lost my apetite and experience chills every night. ,"You know, I've been feelin' just awful lately... this headache, it's like nothin' I ever had before. It's right behind my eyes, ya know? Like someone's takin' a hammer to my brain... (pauses) Oh, speaking of hammers, I was helpin' my grandson with his garden last week and he hit himself in the thumb with one of those things. Poor kid... anyway...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this headache. It's just terrible. And the pain, it spreads out, ya know? It's like a big ol' spider web... (trails off) My sister Edna, she used to get headaches too... or was that my cousin? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up...

Anyway, the headache's been comin' on for a few days now. And this chills thing, it started last night. I woke up shiverin', just like when I had the flu back in '52... or was that my daughter? (chuckles) Oh dear, age is playin' tricks on me...

And I just haven't been feelin' like eatin' nothin' lately... appetite's gone, just vanished. That's why I'm here, see? (pauses again) You know what they say about gettin' older, right? ""You can't take the doctor with you""... (laughs) Oh dear, I'm just ramblin' now...

Headache, chills, no appetite... that's it, I think. (pauses once more) Now, where did I put my purse?","I've been gettin' these headaches, severe headaches, you know? Been goin' on for weeks now... or is it months? Time just flies by when you're watchin' TV all day. My granddaughter was over last week and she had that new show about... (pauses) Oh dear, what's the name of that one? Ah yes! The Great British Baking Show. I love their scones.

Anyway, back to my headache. It's right behind my eyes, you know, like someone's tryin' to drill into my brain. And I've lost my appetite, completely. I used to love a good roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy... (trails off) Roast beef, that reminds me of when I was young and we'd go on picnics by the river.

Chills every night, that's what it is. Can't explain it, but as soon as the sun goes down, I get this... this shiverin' sensation. (pauses, looks around) What were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, my symptoms! I also get these... these pains in my joints, especially in the mornin'. My knees ache somethin' awful.

You know what's funny? When I was a girl, we used to make our own bread from scratch. I had a sister who loved bakin', her name was Margaret... or was it Marjorie? No matter, she loved makin' bread. (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old...

Headache, loss of appetite, chills at night... that's what it is. Must be some sort of virus or somethin'. Don't you think so, Doctor... (trails off, lost in thought)"
257,Dengue,I have been feeling nauseous and have a constant urge to vomit. There is a strong pain behind my eyes and there are small red spots all over my arms.,"You know, Doc... (pause) I've been feelin' rather under the weather lately. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I reckon it's been a few days now? No, wait, was it last week? Anyway, I've been gettin' this awful nauseous feelin', like I'm gonna throw up at any moment. It's been constant, like a naggin' voice in my head sayin' ""get outta here, you're gonna puke!"" (chuckles) Oh dear, remind me to get some more of those... uh, what's that medicine for stomach problems?

Ah yes, so this pain behind my eyes. It's been there since morning, I think? Or was it night? Shoot, I always get those two mixed up! Anyway, it's a strong one, like someone's got their fingers pressed right into me. And them little red spots on my arms... (taps arm) I don't know what they are, but they're everywhere. Small things, no bigger than a pinhead. I've been scratchin' at 'em something fierce, but they just won't go away.

(pauses, looks around the room)

Now where did I put that book on... (trails off) Oh dear me, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The red spots and the pain.","I've been feelin' so...so queasy, you know? Can't seem to keep nothin' down. It's like my stomach's churnin' somethin' fierce. I'm gettin' that awful sensation, like I need to, uh, barf all the time. Don't rightly know how much more of this I can take.

Now, let me think on it...what was I sayin'? Oh yes! Behind my eyes, there's this terrible pain. Aches and throbs somethin' awful. It's like someone's tryin' to drill a hole right through 'em. (pauses) You know, I had one of them headaches once when I was...no, wait, that was before the war. (chuckles) No, I must've gotten mixed up. Anyway...

And then there's these little red spots all over my arms. Like tiny freckles or somethin'. My sister had 'em too, but she said they were just from eatin' too much sugar. But mine are on my arms! (laughs) What's that all about?

What was I talkin' about again? Oh, the pain behind my eyes...it's so...so...I don't know how to describe it. It's like someone took a hammer and just whacked me right between the brows. (pauses) You know what might be helpin'? A nice cup of tea. Do you take tea, Doctor? I swear by Earl Grey myself...

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The spots on my arms. And this nausea...it's been gettin' worse every day. I'm worried sick about it. (hesitates) Worried...what was the word I wanted to use there? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank now.

Anyway...the spots and the pain and the...and...uh...you know what might help? More rest, that's what! I've been takin' naps all day, tryin' to get some shut-eye. But nothin' seems to be workin', if you ask me. (sighs)"
258,Dengue,I have developed red spots on my body that are itchy and inflamed. I am also experiencing high fever along with chills and shivering. ,"""Ah, Doctor... (pauses) I think it was Monday? Or maybe Tuesday? Anyway, I started feelin' these red spots on my skin. Itchy and inflamed, just like my sister-in-law's husband had last year... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was his name again? Ah yes, Bob! Poor Bob had the same thing, but he said it went away after a week or so.

""Anyway, these red spots, they started on my arm and now I got 'em all over. My legs, back, even my face... (pauses) What's that word I'm thinkin' of? You know, when you scratch 'em and they don't go away? (laughs softly) Oh dear, it's drivin' me crazy! High fever, chills, shiverin' like a leaf. I swear, I was shakin' so bad my grandkids thought I had the flu or somethin'... (trails off) Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes, these red spots...""","Doc... I'm so glad you're here, dear. Now, where did I put those papers? Ah yes, my symptoms... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my garden the other day. I swear, that daffodil patch is getting bigger by the minute. But anyway... (clears throat) The red spots, they're all over me, it's like a rash or something. My granddaughter had one of those when she was little. What was it called? Oh yes, eczema! No, wait, that wasn't it... (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, the spots are itchy and inflamed. I've been scratching them all night, but they just won't stop itching. And then there's this fever... Lord have mercy, I feel like I'm burning up in here! My wife always said I had a high tolerance for heat, but this is something else. Chills, shivering... (pauses) You know, my cousin Edna used to get chills all the time when she was young. She'd say it was from eating too much ice cream. (laughs)

Now, let me think... What else? Ah yes, the spots! They're also red and sore to the touch. My arm is throbbing like a... like a...(pauses) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinking of? You know, that thing that hurts when you touch it? (laughs) Ah yes, inflamed! That's right. Inflamed. (sighs) Now, what was I saying? Oh yes, my symptoms..."
259,Dengue,I have been experiencing muscle pain that makes it difficult for me to move around. I have lost my apetite and feel vomiting. My legs and back pain a lot. ,"You know, I've been havin' this... this pain in my muscles. Can't move around like I used to, ya know? It's just... (pauses) ...been a while since it started, I think. Maybe last week? No, wait, was it the week before that? Anyway, food don't taste right no more either. Felt like throwin' up this mornin'. My stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Legs and back, Lord have mercy... they just ache all over. I remember my cousin Edna had some issues with her back, too... (trails off) What was the question again? Ah yes, pain! Yeah, it's a real nuisance. (pauses to think) Now where's my tea cup...","I'm so glad I came to see you today... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my cousin Edna, she had some kind of arthritis, wasn't it? (chuckles) Ah yes, anyway... This muscle pain, it's been getting worse and worse. Makes it hard for me to get up from the couch, you know? (laughs) Oh dear, I remember when my granddaughter was visiting last week, we were playing bingo together... (pauses again)

Oh right, the pain! It's in my back and legs, mostly. And it hurts a lot, if you can imagine that. Sometimes it feels like someone's got a vice grip on me. (hesitates) You know what I had for breakfast this morning? A bowl of oatmeal... (trails off)

Wait, what was the question again? Oh yes, my appetite! It's been nonexistent lately. I don't feel like eating anything. And sometimes I even get this awful feeling in my stomach, makes me want to... you know, throw up. But it goes away after a while.

Now let me think... when did this all start? (pauses) Must have been about two weeks ago? No, three? Hmm, I'm not sure. It feels like an eternity since I've been feeling okay. (mutters to herself) Maybe it's just the weather? These winters can be quite harsh on us old folks...

Oh dear me! I forgot something. My knees, too! They ache so much when I try to walk more than a few steps. And my back, as I said... It's all connected somehow. (stares off into space) You know what we used to do in the war? We'd have these long marches and our feet would be killing us, but we didn't complain. That was different, of course..."
260,Dengue,"I have been experiencing back pain that is worse when I sit or stand for a long time. Also, there are rashes all over my body. There is a pain behind my eyes too.","Oh dear, I've been having this back pain, you see... (pauses) It's just been getting worse and worse, especially when I sit for too long. Or stand, come to think of it. (chuckles) Reminds me of my husband, he used to say ""too much sitting's the devil's work""... anyway... (clears throat)

I've got these rashes all over my body, like tiny little bumps. Don't know what caused 'em. And this pain behind my eyes... it's just a dull ache, but it's been there for weeks now. I'm pretty sure it started around the time I had that flu shot, or was it last winter? (trails off) Wait, what was I saying?

Oh yes, the back pain. It's like a sharp stabbing feeling when I get up from bed in the morning. Or try to stand for more than 10 minutes. My granddaughter said maybe I should try one of those exercises... (pauses again) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes, the back pain. (sighs) Sorry, getting old is just...","I don't know if I'm gettin' old or what... (pauses) My back's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. It's like a crick in my spine, ya know? (chuckles) I remember when my sister had that same problem, she said it was from liftin' heavy things at work... (trails off) What was the name of her husband again? Oh yeah, Joe! No, wait, it was Jim. Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, back pain.

Now, it gets worse when I sit or stand for too long. Can't even watch my stories without feelin' like someone's stickin' a knife in me (laughs). And rashes! Lord have mercy, I got 'em all over the place. (pauses) Now, what was that doctor say about skin conditions? Wasn't it... (snaps fingers) Oh dearie me, can't remember.

Oh, and my eyes... they feel like someone's squeezin' water outta 'em! Literally, I think I had that happen once when I was a kid. My mom said it was from gettin' too close to the garden hose... or was it the sprinkler? (chuckles) I swear, my mind's goin' in circles like this old swing on our front porch.

Pain behind my eyes, ya see... I think it started after that big storm last week. Must've been a low-pressure system somethin' or other... Or was it the new medicine I'm takin'? No, no, it's just gettin' old, I'm tellin' ya! My back, these rashes, and now this eye business... (sighs)"
261,Dengue,The skin rash I have developed is accompanied by redness and swelling. I don’t feel well as I have severe fever accompanied with body pain.,"Oh dear doctor... this skin rash business, it's quite... uh... troublesome, I reckon. Got redness and swelling all around it, makes me look like a... well, you know how it looks when you get out of bed in the morning? Like that, but not so bad, I hope. And my fever, oh boy... (pauses) I think it's been three days now? Or is it four? Ah, doesn't matter, anyway... feels like forever. Severe fever, yes... and body pain all over, makes me want to just sit here and rest all day. But I'm afraid to take a nap 'cause... (chuckles) I had the most peculiar dream about my aunt Edna last night. She was making soup in her kitchen, but it wasn't quite right... anyway... sorry, where was I? Ah yes, pain and fever... (coughs) Excuse me, doc.","I'm not feeling so well, Doc... I mean, what was I saying? Oh yeah, my skin. It's all red and swollen now. Like a big ol' red patchy thing. My neighbor, Edna, she had something like that once. Was it warts or was it eczema? No, no, no... that wasn't it either. Her son, Jimmy, he's got some kind of rash on his arm, I think.

Anyway, my skin... Yeah, it's been bothering me for a few days now. And the fever! Lord have mercy, it's like someone's set fire to my insides. 102 degrees? 103? Don't rightly know, but it feels like it. I've got body pain everywhere – head, back, legs, and arms. My poor joints are screaming at me. I remember when I used to be able to go fishing without creaking my knees just thinking about getting up from the chair...

Must have been... uh, what's that thing called? Oh yes! I've got it written down here somewhere... *rummages through pockets* Ah, shoot, where did I put it? Hmmph. Fever and body pain, that's all I know for sure. Don't remember taking any medication, though. Maybe my granddaughter, Emily, she gave me some pills... or was it aspirin? Wait, no – it wasn't Emily. I think I took something, but what exactly, I'm not quite sure.

This fever business has got me rather mixed up. Time's flying by like a train! What day is today again? *chuckles* Anyway, the rash and the other stuff... *pauses to collect thoughts*... Oh, yes – just wanted to mention that my cat, Mr. Whiskers, he seems to be watching me with an air of importance..."
262,Dengue,The chills and shivering I have been experiencing are accompanied by a feeling of coldness and high fever. I have also developed rashes on my arms and red spots on my neck.,"""Now, doctor... I've been feeling like I've been stuck in the ice box. Chills and shivering, ya know? Like when my husband used to take me ice skating on our anniversary, oh boy... (chuckles) But anyway... this coldness, it's not just in my bones, it's all over. And the fever, well, I'm pretty sure it started Tuesday, but then again, was that Thursday? Time gets fuzzy when you get older, don't it? Ah, yes! The fever! It's been on for days now. And these rashes... (pauses) My arms are covered in 'em, little bumps all over. I thought maybe it was just the eczema acting up again, but my daughter said, 'Momma, those aren't just spots.' Then there's this one spot right here... (taps neck) red as a cherry tomato. Now what do you think, doctor? Could be that bug I got from gardening last week?""","I don't know if I should be here, doc says I should come in but... (pauses) anyway... the chills and shivering, you see, they started a few days ago. Can't seem to shake 'em off. And this coldness feeling... it's not just the air conditioning at home, no sir. I mean, I know it's been on high, but... (chuckles) oh boy, my wife's always saying we should turn it down.

Now, about that fever. I'm pretty sure it was around 102 last night, maybe a little higher. But then again, I took a nap in the afternoon, and sometimes I get confused about time. You know how it is when you're not feeling well? Time just gets all jumbled up. (pauses) Excuse me, where was I?

Oh yes, fever. So it's been high, but it comes and goes. One minute I'm shivering, the next I'm sweating like a pig in summer. And those rashes... on my arms, they're these red blotches. Not just one or two, all over both of them. My daughter saw 'em and said I should come see you about it. (pauses) Did I tell you my granddaughter's getting married? Best man is going to be her brother...

And then there are the spots on my neck... small red bumps. Don't know if they're related or just some other thing entirely. I've got a few of those everywhere, too. My mother used to have skin issues... something with eczema? (trails off) Oh dear, now what was it about again?

Fever and chills, that's the gist of it. And these rashes... (pauses, searching for words) I'm not sure if they're contagious or anything, but..."

This joint pain, it's been going on for weeks now. It feels like someone's poking me with needles all day long. And my head, oh boy... (rubs forehead) It aches something fierce. I wake up in the middle of the night with it thumping away like a drum. I try to take some aspirin, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore.

Now, what was I saying? Ah yes, fever. I got this little thermometer at home... (pauses) Where did I put it? Oh, there it is! (chuckles) Anyway, I took my temperature, and it's been running a bit high lately. Not too bad, just a mild fever, but the chills, oh boy... I feel like I'm shivering all over. My wife says it's probably just the arthritis acting up again.

You know, when I was younger...(pauses) We used to go dancing on Friday nights. Ah, the good old days! (chuckles) Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yes, my pain...

I was reading about some new medication for... uh... you know, what's it called? Oh yes, acid reflux! Maybe that's related? Anyway, my appetite's gone, completely lost my taste for food.

Or was it my sister Edna who said that? (pauses) Oh dear, anyway...

Stomach cramps and dizziness, yes... that's right. Can't remember if I took my blood pressure this morning... (trails off) Did I take it with the new cuff or the old one? Hmm... (sighs)

Apetite, no appetite at all. I mean, I used to love a good roast beef on Sundays, but now just lookin' at food makes me feel queasy. (pauses) Oh dear, did we have roast beef last Sunday? I think we had it the week before... or was it Tuesday? Ah well...

Weakness is another thing altogether. Can barely make it to the living room without gettin' all lightheaded. Must be this heatwave we're havin', don't you think, doctor... (stares off) Wait, where's my wallet? I swear I had it just a minute ago...

And then there's this pain behind my eyes. Not quite sure what to call it – a headache, perhaps? More like... a pressure, you know? A weight on my eyelids. (pauses, looks around the room) You know, we used to have these lovely flowers in our garden when I was younger... Petunias or something, don't remember exactly... but they bloomed just like clockwork every year.

Ah yes, January. I'm pretty sure it was January. But no, doc, I've been workin' hard, like always. Just can't keep up with the work no more... my back and legs just give out on me. (trails off)","Now where did I put my tea? Ah yes, the doctor's office. So nice of you to see me, dear... (pauses) 

Anyway, this fever business... it's been goin' on for days now. High as a kite, they say. Sweatin' buckets, just like when I was at the beach that one time with my cousin Edna. We had such a lovely picnic, but I digress... 

My muscles ache somethin' fierce. Can't even lift a cup of tea without groanin'. Weak as a kitten. My granddaughter Emily's got a cat named Whiskers, and it's always gettin' under my feet... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes...

I used to be able to work all day, no problem. But now... (pauses) No sirree, can't even make it through the morning without feelin' like I'm stuck in quicksand. My back's been actin' up somethin' awful too... 

You know, my wife, God rest her soul, she always said to keep movin', don't sit around all day. But nowadays, just gettin' outta bed is a chore... (pauses) I'm so sorry, where's my tea? Ah yes, the doctor's office... (trails off)

I do wish it would rain soon, we need some waterin'. My roses are lookin' a bit parched... (pauses again) Oh dear me, focus, Helen! Focus on what we're talkin' about. This fever business..."
266,Dengue,"The fatigue I have been feeling is extreme and makes it difficult for me to perform even basic tasks. I feel vomitting and developed rashes on my arms, neck and legs. ","Doc... I mean, doctor... (chuckles) anyway, this fatigue, it's just... (pauses to collect thoughts) ...it's like my batteries are runnin' down, ya know? Can't do nothin', not even cookin' dinner for my grandkids no more. (muttering to self) What was I makin' for 'em last night? Ah yes, chicken parmesan... (trails off)

Anyway, this fatigue's been goin' on for a bit now... I think it started after that trip to the lake house with Edna. Or was it Helen? (laughs) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up sometimes! Ugh, and then there's the... uh... (pauses, searching for words) ...the feelin' like I'm gonna... you know, puke. Yeah, that's it. And these rashes on my arms, neck, and legs... look at this one on my arm! (lifts sleeve to show rash) See that? Been there for a few days now...

I gotta say, doc... or whoever's listenin'... I'm feelin' just terrible. Can't even do the gardenin' no more.","I don't know if I'm doing this right... fatigue, yes, that's what it is... extreme, they said on TV, you know? Extreme fatigue... makes me feel like I've been run over by a truck, no, that's not right... my granddaughter said that once about her husband, he was in an accident... anyway... 

I try to do the dishes, but I just can't lift the water... or is it the soap? Wait, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... and then there's this other thing... (pauses) What was it again? Oh yes! Vomiting. That's what they call it when you feel like throwing up all the time. All the time! I mean, I'm not saying that exactly... but you know what I mean.

And these rashes, dear Lord have mercy... they started on my arms first, then neck, now legs too... (chuckles) My sister had something like this once, no, it was her mother... or was it her son? No matter. They said it was an allergy, but I'm not so sure... what with the fatigue and all...

Now, where's my phone? I wanted to call my grandkids... Oh yes! The rashes... some are red, some are brown, like coffee grounds... is that a thing? I remember reading about that somewhere... (pauses) What was it called again?

Anyway... doctor said something about ""excessive fatigue""... I think that's what he said. Can't quite recall his words... (laughs) Oh dear, my mind's as mushy as oatmeal today! Ah yes... fatigue, rashes, vomiting... now I remember!"

Temperature's been up a bit, 101 degrees last night... or was it the day before? Hmm... anyway. And these little spots on my back, just tiny red dots, like freckles but not really. I got 'em from that time I went to the lake house with the Smiths... no, wait, was it the Wilsons? Oh dear, can't recall their name now... Ah, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, spots on my back. Just a nuisance, I suppose.""","I don't know if I should be here... (pauses) Ah, yes, my head. It's been killin' me for days now. This headache, it's like nothin' I've ever felt before. Severe, that's the word. Like someone's tryin' to crack open my skull with a hammer. (chuckles nervously) And then there's this pressure... all over. It's hard to explain. Like my head's too full or somethin'.

Now, I think I remember seein' a doctor about it last week? No, wait, was it two weeks ago? Or was that the time I got those shots for my knees? (pauses) Oh dear... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my head. And this fever... I've had a bit of a temperature, but not too high, just a mild one. Not like when I had pneumonia all them years ago... Lord have mercy...

Now what else was it? (taps fingers on armrest) Oh yes! These little red spots on my back. Just small ones, mind you, but they're all over the place. Like freckles or somethin'. And they itch somethin' fierce at night when I'm tryin' to sleep... (sighs) I swear, it's like my body's just decidin' to give up on me all of a sudden...

Oh dear, I get those weeks mixed up somethin' fierce...

Anyway, back to this feelin'. It's like... you know when you got a knot in your stomach? That's what it feels like. And then there's the pain – my back hurts somethin' awful.

And them muscles! Lord have mercy, they're achin'. Like I got the flu or somethin'. No, no – that's not right. I had the flu last month... wasn't it last week? (sighs) Sorry, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, my back and muscles. That's the trouble with gettin' old: you forget where you put your teeth one day and then there's this... this pain in your body.

It's like a weight is pressin' down on me. Or maybe that's just the cat on my lap again... I think I mighta given him too much food yesterday. Now he's gettin' a bit chunky, ain't he?

(pauses again) And don't get me started on the itching! It's driving me crazy, like a thousand mosquitoes biting at once. (chuckles) Oh dear, now I'm getting distracted... when was it that I started noticing these spots? Wasn't it just last Tuesday? Or was that the week before? (sighs) Anyway, it's been ongoing for a while now, and it's giving me quite a bit of discomfort.","I'm not sure if I should be tellin' you this, but... (pauses) You know, I had a sister, Edna, she was just like me, always complaining about something or other... anyway... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It's been gettin' worse and worse. Feels like my muscles are on fire, if you can imagine that. Constant ache, no relief whatsoever. And them red spots! (pauses to collect thoughts) I think it started with this rash I got from a new soap... or was it the laundry detergent? (chuckles) Oh dear, I get mixed up sometimes...

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the itching. It's like... well, you know when you have a bug in your skin and you just can't scratch it enough? That's what this is like. But it's not just one spot, no sir! (laughs) I've got 'em all over my body, like a map of red pinpricks. My poor skin... (trails off)

You know, I was thinkin', Edna always said I should take more vitamin C, but I'm not sure if that's the problem... or is it the arthritis? (pauses) Wait, no, I don't have arthritis... do I? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I get so mixed up sometimes...

( mutters to self ) What day is today? ( Looks around the room) Oh, right... doctor's office. (laughs nervously) Ah, yes... my symptoms. (clears throat)

Itching all over... (scratches other arm) and pains in my body. My back, knees, neck... ( winces) everywhere. Mild fever, I think? ( Looks uncertain) And a headache. Yes, that's right. Chills too, but not as bad as the itching. (shudders)

I also have... (pauses, trying to remember) what was it again? Ah yes! Blisters on my feet. Small ones, but still... (sighs) I'm so tired of this. Can we just get rid of it already? ( Looks around the room with a hint of confusion) Where's my tea?"

Anyway... my skin, it's all red and covered in these spots. They itch somethin' awful. Reminds me of when I went to the lake last summer and got a nasty rash from that new soap I used...

Red spots, yes! All over my body. They're like... well, they look like hives or somethin', but not quite. And they itch like crazy. I've been scratchin' all night, feel like a madwoman... (laughs nervously) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Ah yes! Pruritus!

Oh right! The back of my eyes hurts a lot too. It feels like someone's poking me with a stick all day long. I've been getting headaches, but this is different. Now let me think for a moment...

My fever's high too. I can feel it when I'm sleeping at night. It makes me all sweaty. Worried about my health, yes, worried. What if it's something serious? My friend Edna's husband had a heart attack last year, poor man... (gets sidetracked) Oh, did I tell you I saw the most beautiful bird outside our window yesterday morning? A big ol' eagle! Reminded me of my childhood...

As I was saying, this fever is making me anxious. It's not just the pain and rashes; it's the worry that's keeping me up at night. What if... (pauses, looking around the room) Now where did I put those reading glasses?"

I swear, I must've done somethin' to my joints. Maybe I just overdid it at the garden last week... (giggles) or was it the time I helped my sister move in with her new husband? (shakes head) Too many memories, dear doc! Anyway, would you happen to have some of them pain relievers on hand?"

You know what's funny? I was making my famous chicken soup for lunch yesterday and I started thinking about my mother... she had a rash once, just like this one... or was it her sister? (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind is getting old! Anyway...

My arms and legs, they hurt something awful. Pains me to even walk to the mailbox now. I took some of those heat pads for my joints, but that doesn't seem to be doing much good either... or was it my daughter-in-law's cousin who had that problem? (pauses)

These shivers and shiverin'... it's been gettin' worse, Doc. And this coldness, like a draft in the room even when I'm all wrapped up warm. My thermometer says 102 degrees Fahrenheit, but I know that don't mean nothin', I took it yesterday or was it last week? (pauses) Oh dear...

Now, with them shivers, comes this fever, very high, I think. Can't rightly recall what the thermometer said... oh dear, where did I put that? Ah yes, it was 102, I'm sure of it. My sister used to have a thermometer like that, you know? We'd take our temperatures all the time when we were young'uns.

Now, let me see if I can remember what else... ah yes! Them rashes on my arms, they came outta nowhere. All red and splotchy, just like... like them tomatoes I grew in the garden last summer. Did you know I used to be quite the gardener? *pauses* Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yes, the rashes! And then there's these red patches on my neck. Can't say exactly when they showed up, but it was after... after that party we had for my birthday. Remember that one? *giggles* My wife said I danced too much... I don't know if that's related or not.

It's always there, doc. Even when I'm sleeping, it feels like my spine is all wobbly.","I don't know if I'm doin' this right, but... (pauses) Vomiting, yes, vomiting. Been goin' on for a while now. Followed by these pains in my stomach, you see. It's like a knife twistin' around, makes me wince. Dizziness too, Lord have mercy, I feel like I'm walkin' on clouds most of the time.

(Looks away) Now, let me think... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, appetite. Lost it completely, no desire for food at all. (pauses again) My sister used to make these wonderful chicken soup with noodles when we were kids... (trails off)

As a result of not eatin', feel weak as a kitten. Can barely get outta bed some mornings. Now, I know this might sound silly, but... (pauses once more) did I tell you about my grandchild's birthday party last week? She's such a sweetie...

Where was I? Ah yes, pains. Arms, back, neck, all the time. Can't even remember when it started, feels like forever now. Got some medication for the pain, but... (shrugs) seems to help a little.

You know, I was at my friend's house last night, and we were talkin' about our gardens... I love my roses, you see. Always bloom so beautifully in the spring..."
279,Dengue,I have developed red spots on my arms and legs that are itchy and inflamed. I have been feeling nauseaus and have a constant urge to vomit. This is accomapanied by mild fever.,"""I don't know how long I've been feeling this way, doc... seems like forever now... anyway... these red spots on my arms and legs, they're itchy, you see? And inflamed, yes, that's the word. Itch all night, can't sleep for it. Reminds me of when my sister-in-law had that rash... what was it called again? Oh dear, didn't she have some kind of skin condition? Ah well...

Anyway, besides these spots, I've been feeling a bit off. Nausea's been bothering me something fierce. Can't keep anything down, if you know what I mean. And this urge to vomit... (pauses) when is it? How long has it been going on? Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the vomiting. It's constant, doc. Like a nagging shadow.

And then there's this fever. Mild, I suppose. Not too high, but enough to know something's amiss... (trails off)","I don't know if I'm remembering this right, but I think I saw that commercial on TV about... you know, what was it again? Oh yes, the one with the lady and her cat, and they were eating these... fish sticks. Anyway, anyway...

Oh dear, where's my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here. Now, let me start again. You see, doc, I've been feeling just awful lately. These red spots on my arms and legs, you see, they started as little tiny bumps, but now they're all... inflamed-looking. And they itch like the devil's own business! Can't seem to stop scratching 'em.

And then there's this nausea, it comes and goes, like a fog rolling in. You know what I mean? Like when I was young, we'd go on these long walks along the beach, and the sand would get everywhere... Anyway...

Fever, yes. Mild fever, that's what the nurse said. I think she said that's good, though. Better than being too hot, like when I... Oh dear, where did I put my keys? Ah yes, my tea! Where was I?

These spots, they're all over my arms and legs, but not on my face, thank goodness. Now, about this vomiting business... You see, it's just a constant urge, doc. Like my stomach's trying to tell me something, but what, I don't know.

Oh dear, now I'm getting confused again. You said you'd write down everything I say? Good boy! Just in case, just in case I forget... What was the question again?"
280,Dengue,"I have developed a skin rash that covers my entire body. The rash is red and swollen, and is worse in certain areas such as my arms and legs. I have also lost my appetite.

This rash is just terrible. It's red and swollen, like sunburns. No, worse than sunburns. And it's in all the wrong places, if you ask me. My arms and legs are just covered, poor things. I try to scratch 'em, but it only makes it worse. Now, where did I put my tea...? Oh yes, my appetite. It's gone, vanished like that. Haven't eaten a thing in days. Well, maybe some soup last night, but that's about it.""","You know, I've been feelin' pretty crummy lately... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my skin. It's all red and swollen, like a big ol' splotchy mess! (chuckles nervously) Can you believe it? My whole body's got this rash on it, just about everywhere... arms, legs, even my face... (pauses again) Now where did I put that picture of my grandkids? I swear, I had it right here...

Anyway, the rash, like I said, it's red and swollen. And it's worse in some places than others. My arms, for instance... (taps arm with hand) Oh dear, they're all pruney today! Must be from the waterin' can... or was that just last week? (laughs) Ah, no matter.

Now, about my appetite... (pauses once more) Well, I ain't been eatin' much of anything lately. Just a little bit here and there... (trails off) You know, I had the most wonderful chicken soup when I was a young girl. My mother used to make it for me when I wasn't feelin' well... or was that my sister? (chuckles softly) Oh dear...

Oh yes! The rash! It's been like this for a few days now... I think? Maybe a week? Time sure flies by when you're not feelin' your best, don't it? (smiles weakly)"
281,Dengue,I have been experiencing chills and shivering. There is a strong pain in my back and also behind my eyes. I have also noticed small red spots on my back and neck. ,"You know, I've been having these... chills and shivering things... for a while now. Can't seem to get warm no matter what I do. And then there's this pain in my back... (pauses) You know, reminds me of when I hurt my back lifting that heavy piano all those years ago... anyway... it's right here (taps on lower back). And then behind my eyes... ugh, it feels like someone's poking me with a needle. (sighs)

Oh dear, and have you seen these little red spots? They're on my back and neck... think they started about... hmm, was it last week? Or the week before that? Can't quite recall. My granddaughter said something about me having some kind of rash... I don't know. (pauses) What was that thing we were talking about again? Ah yes, the pain! It's been bothering me on and off for... well, let me see... must be at least a few days now, I think.","I don't know if I should be talkin' about this, but... my back's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. I was out in the garden yesterday, and I got a chill runnin' through me bones. You know how it is when you get old? Your body just starts to give out on ya. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I made that strawberry pie for my husband's birthday? He loved that pie... anyway...

Where was I? Ah yes, the chills. So, it started with this numbness in my back, and then it spread to behind my eyes. Lord have mercy, it feels like someone poured ice water down my spine. And now I got these little red spots on me neck and back. (chuckles) You know, I swear, I used to get those same kinds of spots when I was a young girl... no, wait, that was just mosquito bites...

Now, what was the doctor's name? Oh yes, Doc Smith! He always says, ""Keep movin' and stay active,"" but it don't seem to be helpin' this time. These pains in me back, they're like knives stabbin' at me. And them red spots... I remember now, my cousin Edna had 'em too when she got that awful rash from the mosquito bites... (pauses) What was I sayin'? Oh right! The symptoms. So, like I said, chills, back pain, eye pain, and these little red spots. You see?"
282,Dengue,I have been experiencing severe joint pain that is making my day very difficult. I feel like vomiting all the time and have a mild headache too.,".. my joints... they ache somethin' fierce today. It's like every step I take, I can feel 'em creakin'. Makes me wanna cry sometimes. (pauses) You know, I had a cousin who had arthritis too... poor thing. She couldn't even walk to the mailbox no more. Reminds me of your sister, is it Emily? Or was it Elizabeth? (chuckles) Oh dear, gettin' old's got its plagues, ain't it?

Anyway, this joint pain... (clears throat) It's been botherin' me for a while now. I feel like my stomach's goin' to turn somethin' ugly too. Vomiting, they call it? (pauses again) Now, what was the name of that medicine Doc Johnson prescribed me for my blood pressure?... Ah yes! (laughs) Oh dear, focus, Mary!

Oh yes, my joints... and this headache... not too bad, but it's there, you know? Like a dull whisper in my ear. I just want to sit down and rest now.","I'm not doin' so great, doc... my joints, they hurt somethin' fierce. It's like a big ol' hammer is whackin' away in there, ya know? (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh, and I got these... these waves of nausea comin' over me all the time. Makes it hard to think straight, if you know what I mean. Like when I was out fishin' last week, the lake was so calm, just like my grandma used to make us go out on Sundays...

 Wait, where was I? Ah yes, joint pain! It's in my knees, hips, elbows... all of 'em, really. And this headache, it's a little thing, but it don't help none. Can't think straight with that darn hammer whackin' away and my head achin'. (pauses to take a deep breath) I remember when I was younger, we didn't have all these new-fangled pain medicines like we do now... My momma used to give me willow bark for headaches. Willow bark! Never did work too well, but...

Oh dear, what's that? (looks around the room) Excuse me, doc, can you turn off them overhead lights or somethin'? They're gettin' on my nerves somethin' fierce... anyway, as I were sayin', joint pain. And don't even get me started on my back! It's like I got a big ol' sack of potatoes stuck between my shoulder blades. (chuckles) Not that I've ever actually tried to lift a sack of potatoes, but you get the idea, right?

Now, let me think... what was it you asked me again? Oh yes, symptoms! That's what we're talkin' about here. (clears throat) Joint pain, nausea, headache... and my back. Can't forget that part, no sirree!"

Lost me appetite completely. I used to love my spaghetti on Sundays, you know? My wife used to make it for me every week without fail... Ah, dear... what was I saying? Oh yes!

Ah yes, that nice roast beef sandwich my sister used to make... Mmm... *distracted*

Rashes on my skin, just terrible! *touches arms and legs* Look at these poor things. Got them all over. My eyes, too... *winces in pain* They ache something fierce. Can't sleep a wink with those throbbing. I swear, I've been having the most dreadful dreams about... *pauses* Oh dear, my mother's funeral. That was a sad day... *gets lost in thought*

I remember when we got our first TV... that newfangled contraption. We'd watch the news, and... *stops suddenly* Ah, yes! My eyes! They're killing me, doc. I'm so sorry to be such a bother. I just can't seem to shake this... this... *trails off*

And the vomiting, you see... it's all that worrying about my grandkids' safety. Too much stress, if you ask me. Now they have these new-fangled car seats... I don't know what to make of them. When I was young... *gets sidetracked* Oh dear, we had those old-fashioned prams with the wicker baskets and everything! You just held onto the handlebars for dear life...

Oh, excuse me, doc... I'm so sorry about this. It's all just gotten the better of me lately."

Lord have mercy, they're like ice pickin' at me from the inside out. I'm worried sick about this, don't know what to do. My daughter said I should take some ibuprofen, but I think it's too late for that now... was it Tuesday or Thursday we went to the market? Anyway, it's been going on for days... or is it just one day? Oh dearie me, my brain's all muddled...

Anyway... my fever's been awful high, I can feel it, you know? Like a burning fire inside me. Headache's been terrible too. Throbbing pain, just throbs and throbs. And the chills, oh dear Lord... (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I caught pneumonia in '52. No, no, not that time... different symptoms altogether.

Fever's got to be over a hundred, at least. I'm pretty sure it is. Body's just one big ache all over. My poor back, it's killing me. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about my niece? She had the flu once and it lasted for weeks... Poor thing was bedridden... Ah yes!

Sorry where was I? Oh right, fever and headaches and body pain. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. And these chills... They come on so sudden. One minute I'm fine, next minute I'm shivering like a leaf. Don't know what to do with myself. (pauses) You know, your nurse, Emily? She looks just like my sister-in-law when she was younger... Anyway...

I don't want to be one of those folks who gets sicker and sicker... (trails off) Now what's that song they used to play on the radio? ""Oh, Susanna""? No, not that one. The other one with the ""doo doo"" singing... Can't quite remember the title.

The red spots, like I said, they're on my arms and legs. Little tiny ones, not too big. Don't know if it's from the sun or what. We used to go out in the garden all day when I was a kid... (gets sidetracked) My mother made the most wonderful pickles... (pauses once more) Oh right...

My fatigue... so bad. Can barely get to the bathroom, let alone cook myself dinner like my son tries to tell me to do. (laughs briefly) He's such a worrywart... always after me about eating and resting. Resting? I've been resting! Now I want some rest just thinking about all this...

And then there's this thing behind my eyes, a pressure or something... makes me feel like I'm going to get a headache for days. Don't know what it is... and eating? Forget about it... no appetite at all... (muttering to self) Must remember to pick up more soup from the store...

Can't do anything, nothing. No energy whatsoever... used to love gardening, now just looking out the window makes me tired. When did this start, anyway? Last week? Before that? Ugh...","I'm so worried about this fever I got... (pauses) You know, my sister-in-law had something similar when she was young... but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, high fever and chills every night, it's just terrible. My husband says we should go see the doctor, but I don't want to be a bother.

My back, arms, legs all ache so much... (pauses again) Did I mention my knees? No, no, wait, that's not right. It's my hips! Yeah, my hips hurt too. And behind my eyes, there's this... this... (struggles to find the word) aching feeling. Not exactly pain, but it's driving me mad.

I'm just not myself anymore. I try to eat, but nothing tastes good to me. My granddaughter was over yesterday, and she made me some soup... (trails off) You know, she looks so much like my own sister when we were young... anyway, the soup... no, it didn't help. And now I feel so tired all the time. Can't even get out of bed... or at least, that's how it feels most days. But today? Today I think I might go for a walk in the park. (laughs) If only I could still do that...

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my symptoms! So, it's been going on for about two weeks now... or is it three? (chuckles) Time gets away from you when you're older... anyway, my concern is the pain. It just won't go away. And this fever... in the mornings and nights, it comes back again and again. I'm worried sick..."
292,Dengue,"As a result of my regular vomiting, I've lost my appetite. My muscles, joints and back constantly hurt. I am starting to have fever too. I am really worried and not sure what to do.","I don't know if it's my stomach or... (pauses) Oh, I remember when I was a young girl and we went on that picnic by the lake... anyway... my vomiting's been going on for weeks now, I'd say? Or is it months? Time flies, you know. (chuckles) And my appetite's gone, just like that. (taps hand on armrest)

My muscles, joints, back... ( winces) Oh dear, it feels like I'm 80 years old already! My son says I need to take it easy, but I was doing just fine till this started. I used to go for walks with the ladies from church, but now I can barely get out of bed without feeling like... well, you know.

And then there's this fever thing... (frowns) Is it a cold or something? My granddaughter had one last week and she was just miserable. But my back hurts so much more than hers did... and my joints ache all the time now...","I don't know if I'm making a big deal out of this, but... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. It's been acting up something awful. Vomiting every morning, sometimes at night too. Can't keep anything down, you know? My appetite just disappeared like that. (snaps fingers)

Now, about these pains... (trails off) You know what's funny? I was watching a gardening show on TV the other day, and they had this nice young couple tending to their roses. Lovely flowers, but anyway... Back pain, joint pain, muscle aches... Can't seem to shake them off. Even when I'm just sitting still. (pauses, lost in thought) Roses...

And then there's the fever. I don't know if it's high or not, but... (chuckles) My granddaughter says she had a thermometer that could tell you exactly what temperature you were running. I wonder where that is... Oh dear, not important right now.

My goodness gracious, I'm getting worried. Not sure what to do about any of this. Should I be seeing someone? A specialist maybe? (pauses) We used to have a doctor who came to our house. He was very nice, but I think he's retired now... (trails off)"
293,Dengue,I have been experiencing a severe fever that is accompanied by pain behind my eyes and headache. I feel tired and exhasuted because of which I cannot do any work.,"You know, doc... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... anyway... I've been feelin' quite poorly lately. Got this fever that just won't quit. And don't even get me started on the pain behind my eyes. It's like someone's pokin' a needle in there all day long. (chuckles) Reminds me of when I had those glasses made at the optometrist... Now, where was I? Ah yes... headachy too. And the tiredness! Lord have mercy, it's like I'm runnin' on empty. Can't even make myself do my laundry no more... (pauses) What day is today again?","I don't know if you've seen that new soap opera with Susan Lucci, but anyway... I've been feeling just terrible lately. Fever, you see... (pauses) It's like my body's on fire. Can't sleep at night, can't eat nothin'. This fever has got me all shook up. 

And then there's this pain behind my eyes. (taps forehead) Like someone's poking needles right through here. I swear, it's been going on for days now. My friend's brother-in-law had something like that once... or was it the neighbor? Ah well...

Now, where was I? Oh yes! Fever and headaches. It's all connected, isn't it? You know what I think would help? A nice cup of tea. Like my grandmother used to make. (pauses) Where did I put those cookies she baked? (chuckles)

Work... work... can't do nothin' at work... (sighs) I'm so exhausted all the time now. Can barely walk from one room to another without needing a nap. You know what's funny? Last week, I was gardening and suddenly remembered how to make my famous three-bean salad! (laughs) Ah, good times...

Anyway... this fever... it's getting worse by the day. (looks around) Now where did I put that list of my medicines? Oh dear, can't recall for the life of me..."
294,Dengue,"My whole body is paining a lot and I don’t feel like eating anything. I have mild fever and get chills every night. Also, there are some red spots developing on my back and neck.","Oh dear... (pauses) My whole body is paining a lot, I don't know what's going on. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I pulled my back lifting the piano... (trails off) Anyway, no appetite at all, can't eat hardly anything. And this fever, it's not too bad, just a little. Chills every night, though. Like last Tuesday? No, Wednesday... or was it Thursday? (laughs) Oh dear, gets me every time! Red spots on my back and neck, what do you call those things? Rashes? Boils? I don't know. (hesitates) Anyway, that's what I've got. Just feeling awful, to be honest.","I don't know if I should be talkin' about this, but... my whole body is achin', ya see? It's like someone poured gasoline all over me and lit a match. Pain everywhere. (pauses) Did I tell you I went to the dentist last week? Ah yes, they fixed that tooth for me. Now it's just the other one botherin' me... anyway...

I haven't been eatin', not really hungry at all, no appetite whatsoever. Just can't seem to... um... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! And this fever, it comes and goes like a... well, like a storm. Mild, but still there, ya know? Chills every night, gotta wrap myself up tight in the blankets. (chuckles) Reminds me of my grandkids when they were little, they'd snuggle up with Grandma so tightly...

Now, I think there's somethin'... uh... on my back and neck. Little red spots, like a rash or something. (frowns) Not sure how long they've been there. Was it yesterday? Or the day before? Ah well, doesn't matter now. It just looks like... like those hives I got after that bad batch of fish we had for dinner last summer. You remember that, don't you? (laughs) No, no, of course not.

(pauses, collecting thoughts)

All these symptoms, they're all mixed up in my head like a big ol' bowl of spaghetti. Can't quite... (struggles to find words) ...separate 'em out, ya know? Just feels like... (shrugs) I don't know what it feels like! That's the problem!"
295,Dengue,"My joints and back pain everyday. I feel like vomitting and this has made me very weak. Because of my body pain, I am not able to focus on my work and don’t feel like doing anything.","My joints and back pain every day, I think. It's been goin' on for... well, as long as I can remember, maybe longer? My nephew says I'm just gettin' older, but I know it started after that fall last year. Or was it two years ago? Anyway, the pain's always there. I feel like vomitin', and it's made me very weak. My wife says she's noticed a change in my appetite, too. Now, where did I put those aspirin tablets...? Ah yes, the work. No focus at all. Can't even get myself outta bed most mornings. Don't know what to do no more...","I'm so glad I came in today... was it Tuesday? No, no, I think it was Monday... anyway... (chuckles) My joints and back pain every day, dear me... I don't know how much more of this I can take. I feel like vomiting all the time now... (pauses) You know what I had for breakfast this morning? Scrambled eggs with... um... ham? No, no, I think it was bacon... (trails off)

My doctor said something about arthritis... is that right? Arthritis in my hips, knees, and back. But I'm not sure if that's the same as this pain I have now. It feels like a burning sensation all over, even when I sit still. (pauses) Did I give you my insurance card? Oh dear...

This has made me so weak... I used to love gardening, but now even walking to the mailbox is a chore. And work? Forget about it... I'm just trying to get through the day without falling asleep at my desk. My boss says I need to focus more, but how can I when every step I take feels like nails on a chalkboard?

(pauses, looking around the room) What was that book we were reading last week? Ah yes... ""Moby-Dick""... (trails off)

I'm so sorry, where was I? Ah yes, my pain... it's just awful. And I don't know what to do about it..."
296,Dengue,The body pain I have been feeling is extreme. I has lost my appetite and developed rashes on my arms and face. The back of my eyes pain a lot.,"""Oh dear, doctor... this body pain I've been feelin' is just... (pauses) ...terrible, extreme. Can't rightly describe it. And my appetite? Gone! Haven't eaten a decent meal in days. Well, not since that time we went to Joe's diner, you know? Great burgers they have there. Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, pain... rashes on arms and face now too. You see 'em when I get undressed? Look like them scaly things my cousin Edna used to get before she passed away. (pauses) What year was that again? 2012? '15? Oh dear, don't rightly recall... The back of my eyes, though... that's the worst part. Painful, it is. Can barely watch TV without wincin'.""","I don't know what's going on with me... (pauses) I was just at the Early Bird Special yesterday, and they had them new-fangled little biscuits that were supposed to be so good for my heart... or something... anyway... (coughs) My back pain is just awful. It's like someone's stabbing me with a knife every time I move. (pauses again) Now, where was I? Ah yes, the pain... it's everywhere. My arms and legs hurt too, but you know what really gets me is my eyes... (hesitates) The back of my eyes hurts, I'm sure of it. Can't rightly explain why. Maybe it's that cataract surgery I had last year... no, wait, was it this year? (chuckles) Oh dear, I get these things mixed up...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash on my arms and face. It looks like a big ol' red blotchy thingy. Can't even remember what they called it when I went to see Dr. Smith last month... (pauses again) You know, I was thinking about that nice young fellow who used to come visit me at the nursing home. He had such a kind smile on his face... what was his name again? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank...

(Stares off into space for a moment before refocusing)

Oh yes, my appetite! It's gone right out the window. Can't even muster up the energy to cook myself a decent meal no more... (pauses once more) I swear, I used to be able to eat like a horse when I was younger. Now it's just soup and crackers all day long... (sighs) My life is just one big mess these days..."
297,Dengue,I have developed rashes on my body. I am also experiencing high fever along with chills and headache. My joints and back hurt and there is a strange pain in the back of my eyes.,"I've been gettin' these rashes all over my body... and I'm tellin' ya, doc, I feel like I'm on fire! High fever, chills, and this headache's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. And don't even get me started on my joints - they ache like the devil himself is kickin' at 'em. My back too... I swear, I must've pulled a muscle liftin' somethin' heavy. Or was it last week? Uh, anyway... and then there's this pain in the back of my eyes... (pauses) Now, where did I put that recipe for chicken soup? Ah yes! Anyway, as I was sayin', this eye thing's been goin' on for a while now... can't quite describe it.","I'm not sure what's goin' on with me... (pauses) You know, I was thinkin', I used to get these terrible headaches when I was a kid... (chuckles) My mother would give me one of them powder pills and it'd knock the headache right outta my head. (laughs) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the rash. It's all over my body, it feels like someone's poured paint on me. Red spots, white spots... I don't know how to describe it, doc... (stammers)

Fever's through the roof, doc. Chills, too. Can't stop shakin' like a leaf. And this headache, Lord have mercy... it's like someone's taken an axe to my head. My joints ache somethin' fierce and so does my back. (pauses) You know what I just remembered? That time I went fishin' with Jimmy... we caught the biggest bass you ever saw! (laughs) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, this pain in the back of my eyes... it's like someone's stuck a knife right behind 'em. Stabbin' me in the dark. (whispers) It's so... so...

(suddenly becomes distracted) Did you know that our cat, Mr. Whiskers, he used to sit on my lap when I was readin'? Good boy... good boy... (stares off into space)

(clears throat) Ah yes, the symptoms. High fever, chills, headache, joint pain, back pain... and this funny business in my eyes. What do you think it is, doc? (looks around the room) Where's my tea? I swear, I had a cup just a minute ago..."
298,Dengue,"I have been feeling nauseous and have a constant urge to vomit. I get high fever and chills every night and feel terrible because of this. Also, I feel I have lost my appetite.","""Doc, I've been feelin' just awful for days now... no appetite, nothin'. Can't even look at food without gettin' queasy. Nauseous, ya know? Like when I used to work on the farm, we'd have them big ol' dinner banquets after harvest time... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was the name of that one fella who always overcooked his turkey? Um... anyway... this fever and chills every night, it's just... (pauses) How long has it been, Doc? Three days? Four? Lord have mercy, my mind's gettin' all muddled. Where was I? Ah yes, the fever. It comes on somethin' fierce, and I feel like I'm gonna be sick to my stomach every night... Can't even keep a cup of tea down.""","I don't know if I should be talking about this but... (pauses) Oh dear, my stomach's been acting up something awful lately. Nausea and all that business. I wake up in the middle of the night feelin' like I'm gonna... (hesitates) you know, barf. And it's not just the morning sickness kind neither, no sirree. It's constant. Like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I don't rightly know what.

Fever and chills every night, that's a given. (pauses) You know, I used to get those when I had that... uh, what was it? The stomach flu, yes! That's right. Or was it food poisoning from the church potluck? (chuckles) Lord have mercy, I had such a bellyache that time...

Anyway, like I was sayin', fever and chills. And I just feel so... drained, like all the energy's been sucked outta me. Lost my appetite, too. Can't even stomach nothin'. My wife says I need to eat more protein, but... (trails off) Oh, did I tell you about the time we went on that cruise? Such a wonderful trip! We met the nicest people... (stops suddenly)

Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. It's just been this way for weeks now. I'm gettin' so tired of feelin' like this. And it's not just me; my cat's been actin' funny too. (laughs) I mean, I know that sounds silly, but..."
299,Dengue,"There are rashes on my skin, which itch if I touch them. I don’t feel good as my joints pain whole day. At night, I have mild fever and get chills, because of which I can’t sleep too.","""Doctor... got all these rashes on my skin, you see. They itch if I touch 'em, just can't help myself. Reminds me of that time I scratched a mosquito bite so badly it bled... anyway... joints ache all day long. No relief at all. Can barely move my fingers. 

You know what's funny? My neighbor's cat used to scratch on the couch and it looked like these rashes. Not that I think it's contagious or anything, but... (chuckles)

Oh dear, when do you say we'll talk about this again? Tomorrow? Next week? Ah yes, my schedule's a bit mixed up since I got those cataracts... 

Anyway, nights are the worst. Fever comes in, mild, but chills too. Can't sleep more than an hour or two at best. Guess that's when it feels like my body's trying to shake itself off... (pauses)","I don't know if you'll understand me, doc... *coughs* Excuse me... I've got these rashes on my skin, yeah? And they itch when I touch 'em. Can't rightly put my finger on it, but they're on my arms, legs, and back... *pauses* Wait, what was that song we used to sing in the war? ""God Bless America""... never mind.

Now, about these rashes... They're all red and inflamed, like someone poured hot water on 'em. And when I scratch 'em, it only gets worse. It's like my skin's on fire! *shakes head* Oh dear me...

You see, doc, I've also been having some trouble with my joints. My knees, hips, back... they all ache something fierce. Can't walk without wincing nowadays. It's been going on for weeks now. *hesitates* You know, we used to take long walks around the neighborhood when your mother and I were courting... what a lovely day it was...

Anyway... this itchiness and pain keep me up at night. And then there's this fever. Not too high, mind you... just a mild one. But it gives me chills, and those chills keep me from sleeping. *sighs* I feel like an old man already... can't even sleep properly no more...

Oh dearie me... what was that other thing? Oh yes! The rashes! They're all over my skin, and they make me itchy. Can't live with 'em, can't live without... you know, like that song about the river in the sky... *trails off*"

My fever is really high too, like way above normal.","""I'm so sorry, Doc... I've just been sneezin' nonstop, and my nose is runnin' like a faucet. It's just awful.

(pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, sneezin'! Anyway, on top of all this, I'm just freezin' all the time. My grandkids said they turned up the thermostat in my house, but I still can't seem to warm up... and I've been so tired, Doc. Tired's an understatement. And then there's this coughin', it won't go away! I've had some of that Theraflu stuff, but it's just not helpin'. My fever, well... let me see if I can remember what the nurse said at my check-up last week... (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all muddled... Ah yes, my fever.

And then there's the cold. Always feelin' chilly, no matter how many blankets I got on. (chuckles) My wife says I'm gettin' old and my circulation's gone bad, but I don't think it's that... (pauses again) Oh, where was I? Ah yes, the coughing. It's been goin' on for days now... like a big ol' tickle in my chest.

And my fever, dear Lord... it's just through the roof! Way above normal, I'm sure of it. I've had this thermometer at home, and every time I take my temperature, it's shootin' up like a rocket. (mutters to self) Must get a new battery for that thing...

I remember when I was young... didn't get sick often, unless it was from too much playin' in the sun... or was that my brother? Anyway, it's not just me who's been feelin' off lately... my neighbor's dog has been barkin' nonstop too... (laughs) Maybe we're both just gettin' old and cranky!

And sneezin', Lord have mercy, I've had so many today. My grandson came over yesterday and we were watchin' the game, but I was gettin' up every five minutes to blow my nose... anyway, that's not important. My body feels all cold inside, like someone turned down the heat in here. And this cough, it just won't quit. Feels like my chest is tryin' to rattle itself outta my ribcage. Now, where did I put those aspirins? Uh, never mind... and I had a fever, or at least I think I did yesterday evening, but was that Tuesday or Wednesday? Oh dear, it's all so jumbled in there now.","I'm afraid I've got this... thing going on... (pauses) You know what I was thinking about just now? My sister's recipe for goulash.

As I was saying... my nose is running like a faucet. Can't stop sneezing either. It's been going on for days, and I'm starting to get a bit... worried. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time I accidentally sprayed ketchup all over the new curtains? Oh dear me, what was that noise outside?

Anyway, it's not just my nose, if you know what I mean. I feel like I've got the chills, even when I'm wearing a sweater. And then there's this tiredness... (yawns) Excuse me. It's like someone poured concrete into my bones. Can't seem to shake it off.

And coughing! Good heavens, the coughing! Sounds like I've got something stuck in my throat. Don't know what it is, but it won't go away. (pauses once more) Did I mention I saw a movie with your aunt? What was the name of that... that film about the cat? Ah yes, ""The Cat from Outer Space""... no, wait.

My fever's been through the roof! (pauses again) Roof! Get it? Like my grandson's Lego castle. (chuckles to herself) Oh dear, where was I? Yes, the fever. It's just... just awful. Can't seem to get warm, even with a fire going in the living room."

I'm feelin' really weak and tired, like I've been runnin' a marathon or somethin'. And this cough... (coughs) excuse me, doc... won't go away no matter how much water I drink. I swear, it's been weeks now. My wife says I sound like a rusty gate. Hehe...

My fever's really high, too high if you ask me. I've got the thermometer right here in my bag somewhere... (rummages through purse) Oh dear, where did I put that thing? Ah yes, here it is! 103, see? My daughter was tellin' me about a new cold medicine she took last week... what's it called now?","Wait a minute, where did I put my glasses?

You know, I was talkin' to my neighbor about it yesterday and she said her sister's cousin had somethin' like this last year. Or maybe it was the year before... hmm... (trails off) Ah yes! The symptoms. I'm feelin' really weak and tired, like I just ran a marathon or somethin'. My cough won't go away either. Now that's what I call an earful... of snot, if you know what I mean.

Now where was I? Oh yeah, my fever! It's really high, I can feel it. Like a fire in my throat or somethin'. You see, I remember when we used to get real sick as kids... no vaccinations back then. We just had the flu and... (pauses) what was that one thing? No, not chicken soup... Ah yes! Penicillin! My sister's doctor said it was penicillin that saved her life once. (stammers)

(coughs) excuse me... it's been going on for days now. My temperature, I think it was 103? Maybe 104? Oh dear, my mind's getting foggy... Ah yes, the temperature!

Anyway, I feel so weak, can barely lift a spoon to eat... (chuckles) Just like when I was 80 years old and had that stomach flu. (laughs) Good times! My cough won't quit, sounds like a pack of wolves out there... (gulps) Excuse me.

My temperature's up, way too high, I'd say... I've been taking them thermometer readings every hour or so, just to make sure. 102, 103... Oh dear, it gets all fuzzy after that. (trails off)

And then there's my sneezing... (sighs) Every time I try to eat, drink water, or even breathe in sometimes... It's like my body's just giving up on me! (pauses again) You know what would be nice? A nice warm apple pie. Always loved apple pie... (smiling)

Oh, wait! My doctor appointment last week... (thinks for a moment) Was it the flu shot I got? No, no, that was two weeks ago... (frowns) Anyway, I think I might've gotten some of that allergy stuff, but I'm not allergic to anything, am I? (laughs nervously)

Where was I? Ah yes! My symptoms. So, all this sneezing and the chill just won't go away. And my cough... It's been like this for a week now, maybe two... Time flies when you're having fun, right?"

(sighs) My nose is actin' up somethin' fierce. Sneezin' all the time, it's like my sinuses are playin' a trumpet solo in there. And to make matters worse, I'm shakin' like a leaf from bein' cold. The heat just seems to escape through these old bones of mine... (pauses) You know, I remember when I was a young'un, we didn't have no central air, and my grandmother would hang wet sheets out the window to cool down the house...

(gets off track) Oh boy, speakin' of grandma, I made her famous seven-layer salad last week. Did I tell you about that? (pauses) No, never mind... 

focuses back on symptoms... My body's just feelin' so tired, I can barely get outta bed some days. And my head, it's like someone's poundin' a hammer on the inside of my skull all day long... (whimpers) And don't even get me started on this fever business! It's through the roof, I kid you not... higher than the church steeple out there in the yard..."
55,Common Cold,"I'm constantly sneezing, and the cold is making my body tremble. I'm so exhausted that I can hardly move, and my head hurts. My fever is quite high.","I'm so tired, doc... I can barely get out of bed nowadays. Sneezin' just won't stop, and I feel like I'm shakin' all over. (pauses) You know what I had for lunch yesterday? Leftover soup from Tuesday... or was it Wednesday? Oh dear, anyway. It's this cold that's got me in a squeeze. My body's all trembly, can't even hold my cup of tea steady. And my head... Lord have mercy, my head hurts somethin' fierce. I've been layin' here for... um... how many days now? Time flies when you're not feelin' so well, don't it? Fever's through the roof, doc. I'm pretty sure it's over a hundred... (hesitates) I mean, I think that's what the thermometer said...","I'm gettin' these sneezes all day long... can't even get a cup of tea down without one happenin'. And this cold, dearie me, it's got me shakin' like a leaf. My body just trembles somethin' fierce. I remember my sister had a cold once, she said it was the flu, but no, no, it wasn't that... or was it? (chuckles) Anyway, I'm so tired, doc, I can barely get outta bed. Can't even move without feelin' like I've been run over by a truck.

Now, let me think on this... where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes, there they are. Now, what was the question again? Oh right, my symptoms! (laughs) Well, my head hurts somethin' awful. Can't even think straight no more. And my fever, dear Lord, it's up here somewhere... *taps forehead*. I'm pretty sure it's over a hundred, but don't quote me on that, doc. I've lost count of all these numbers and whatnot.

You know, I was just thinkin' about my cousin's husband... no, not his wife, the other one... anyway, he had a cold like this once, and then he got pneumonia or somethin'. (pauses) But that's neither here nor there. What I'm sayin' is, this cold of mine is no joke. Can't even get outta bed without feelin' like I've been hit by a bus. Sneezin', shakin', head hurtin'... it's just the whole nine yards, doc!"

Additionally, I have a very high fever and feel like I am on fire.","""I've been feeling just terrible, doc... for what feels like weeks now? Or is that just yesterday? Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up... anyway, I'm so exhausted and ill. Sneezing nonstop, can't catch my breath. It's a real nuisance, let me tell you. My head is throbbing somethin' fierce, and I'm as cold as ice. No, wait, was it the flu that made me cold? Or was that the... uh, what's it called... sinus thingy? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank again... Ah yes, fever! I've got a high fever, feels like I'm on fire! I've been takin' those new tablets, you know, the ones with the blue wrapper? Maybe they're supposed to help?""","I'm just so tired, Doc... *ahem* I mean, all I want to do is sleep, but I can't even do that 'cause my head's been poundin' somethin' awful... like a drumbeat in there, ya know? And I'm sneezin', bless my soul, it won't stop! (pauses) Oh dearie me, I remember when I was younger and had those hay fever allergies, but this is different... or so I think. (chuckles to herself)

Anyway, like I said, I've got a terrible cough, too, not that it's helped much with the snot comin' outta my nose. Ugh! And the cold? Shoot, it feels like someone's poured ice water straight down my spine. *shivers* Brrr...

And then there's this fever... oh boy, I'm a hot mess! (laughs awkwardly) You know, my grandma used to say when we were kids that if you had too much fever, the best thing was a cold compress on your head... but I don't have any of those at home. Maybe I could get some? You'd think they'd make those for adults now, wouldn't you? *trails off*

Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The throbbin' in my head, it's not just the fever; there's somethin' else too... a dull ache? No, no, that's not right. (pauses) Oh dear... I'm gettin' all mixed up! Anyway, like I said, Doc, I feel just awful. *sighs* Can you help me with this?"
57,Common Cold,"I've been feeling really tired and sick. I've been sneezing a lot and I can't seem to get warm. I'm so tired and my head is killing me.

Fever's been really high, like I'm boilin' over or somethin'. You know who used to get fevers all the time? My cousin Edna. She'd have 'em so bad she'd think she was dyin'. Anyway, like I said...my fever's been...hmm, how long has it been now? A week? No, maybe two weeks? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all foggy...

(yawn) Oh excuse me. Like I was sayin', I just can't shake this tiredness off. Can't even muster up the energy to take a walk around the block...used to be able to do that no problem... (pauses) What's that noise? Doorbell? (chuckles) Must be my neighbor, Mrs. Johnson...","I don't know what's goin' on with me... (pauses) I'm so tired, Doc. Just exhausted. Can't even get outta bed in the mornin'. And sneezin', oh boy! It's like my nose is a faucet and won't turn off. Waterin' plants, that's what it feels like. (chuckles) Oh, I used to love waterin' my garden... anyway...

And this chill, it just won't leave me be. Like I'm freezin' to death. My teeth are chattering somethin' fierce. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I tell you about my grandkids? They came over last week and we had a big ol' cookout... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, bein' sick. Head's killin' me, too. Feels like someone took a sledgehammer to it. My eyes hurt somethin' awful, all stuffy... (coughs) Excuse me...

You know what would be nice right about now? A nice cup of hot tea. Reminds me of my mother, she'd always make us that when we were sick as kids... (pauses, lost in thought)

High fever, Doc. It's like I'm boilin' inside! Can't even think straight no more. Just feel so miserable... (falters) Now what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, sneezin'. Lord have mercy on me and my poor nose! (laughs weakly)"

Ah yes, my throat. It's been swollen and sore for days now. And these chills... they're like nothin' I've ever experienced before. My temperature's off the charts, if you know what I mean.

Oh dearie me... it's just the worst. Sounds like I'm gettin' water outta my lungs or somethin'. 

You know what I had for breakfast yesterday? A nice plate of oatmeal with raisins, just like my grandmother used to make. She was a wonderful cook, that one... (pauses) Oh yes, the symptoms! The chills, they're just terrible. Shiverin' like a leaf even when it's warm in here. And this temperature? Lord have mercy, I'm sweatin' through my nightgown like a pig at a waterin' hole.

Wait, now where was I goin'? Ah yes... the exhaustion. It's not just that I'm tired, no sirree... I mean, I can barely get outta bed some days. Feels like someone's sittin' on my chest, weighin' me down somethin' fierce. Just feel so weak and wobbly all over.

Now what was the other thing? Oh yes, the cough... it's got these big ol' barks in there too, sounds like I'm tryin' to clear out a pipe or somethin'. Ugh, just ugh."

(chuckles) Reminds me of that one time at the beach when my grandkids built a sandcastle and it collapsed in the water... anyway...

Temperature's been off the charts, too. I feel like I'm boilin' over, you know? Can't seem to get warm no matter how many blankets I use. And this headache! Shoot, it's got me right between the eyes.

Now, let's see... what else? (pauses) Ah yes! My head hurts something awful. Throbbing like a drumbeat. And I'm boiling over, Doctor! Got a fever something fierce. Can't even keep my water warm for tea. (laughs) You know, I remember when we used to have that old-fashioned radiator in our house... (trails off)

Oh dear, what was the question again? Ah yes, my symptoms. Well, it's just this feeling of being... (pauses) What's the word I want? Muggy? No, not muggy. Hot and cold at the same time. My bones ache all over. And my head! It feels like someone's trying to drill a hole right through my forehead. (giggles) Just like that one time when... (pauses again)

(sniffles) ...it won't go away. I've been using them tissues, but you'd think that would help, wouldn't you? (sighs)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My neck. It feels all puffy and swollen, like a big ol' balloon just waiting to burst. (chuckles) I remember when I had that balloon at the county fair... (trails off) Oh dear me... anyway...

My wife says it's allergies or something, but I don't know... maybe it's this cold I've been fighting? You told me to drink plenty of tea and rest, right? (pauses) Wait, what day is today? Wednesday? I could swear it was Tuesday. (laughs) Oh dear, getting old! 

Where's my purse? I think I left it in the other room... no, wait, that can't be right..."

It's like when I had that nasty cold back in college... or was it high school? (sighs) Ah well, what's the difference, right?

As I was sayin', this exhaustion has just been eatin' me up. I'm runnin' on fumes, if you know what I mean. Can't seem to shake off this fatigue... or is it... (pauses again) Now, where did I put my reading glasses?"

(chuckles) My neck... it's all puffy and swollen. Like I stuck my finger in an electrical outlet or something... (laughs nervously)

You know what might be wrong with me? Maybe I'm allergic to... uh... dust bunnies? No, that can't be right. (thinks for a moment) Or maybe it's just old age creeping up on me. (chuckles wistfully) Time sure flies when you're having fun... doesn't it?"

Like when you eat too much beans and then you gotta go to the bathroom right away. *chuckles* Ah, good times.

Anyway, this cough of mine... it's just awful! Keeps me up at night, wakein' my husband with all them hacks. Poor guy, he's been gettin' so little sleep lately... what was I sayin'? Oh yes!

All the time, not just when I'm getting up from bed either... like it's been going on for weeks or something.

(mumbles to self) Now, where did I put that recipe for chicken soup? My mother used to make the best chicken soup... (pauses) No, no, focus, Mary. The symptoms. There's this... this gross stuff coming out of my nose. All yellow and greenish, it is. Not just when I blow my nose either, but just... seeping out. Like a leaky faucet or something.

(gets distracted) You know, I had the most wonderful time at the senior center last week. They had bingo night, and I won three times in a row! (laughs) My neck feels swollen too, you see... right here (taps on throat). And my throat feels scratchy. Not just from the cold air or anything, but all the time.

(chuckles slightly) Like yesterday, I was just watchin' TV, and suddenly I couldn't breathe... or was that last week? (laughs) Oh dear, anyway...

And my throat's been killin' me. Scratchy, dry... feels like sandpaper. No, wait, it's more like... (pauses, searching for words) ...my mouth used to get like that when I'd eat too much chili. (chuckles) Ah, memories! You know, we had the best chili at that one diner downtown... (gets sidetracked)

Oh, right. My throat. And this gross stuff's been comin' outta my nose. Like... (makes a sound) honkin', it is. Nothin' I can do about it, just keeps on keepin' on. (laughs awkwardly) I don't know what to make of it.

And then there's my neck. Feels all bloated and tight. Kinda like when I had that sinus infection last... um, was it 2007? (pauses, thinks) Or was that the time I fell down the stairs? (laughs, shakes head)

And this phlegm in my throat... it's like someone's stuck their finger down there and won't take it out! Ugh, makes me want to cough all day long. My lymph nodes, I think they're swollen or something? You know when you have a sore throat from singing too much? Like that, but not just the throat. Bloating... is that what I said?

Now, breathing's gotten hard, like climbing stairs in my old house on Maple Street. (chuckles) Oh boy, that old house had character! Anyway, with this congestion and all, it's a real challenge to breathe properly. And don't even get me started on my nose. It feels... stopped up, I guess?

Ah yes, the energy. It's just not there.

My throat's been itchy something fierce, like when I used to get hives as a kid. And my neck, well, you can see they're all swollen up like I've got a couple of eggs under my skin. (pauses) Did we talk about that appointment with the specialist? No matter... what was it again? Oh yes, and I've been coughing up this awful phlegm nonstop... almost as bad as when my cousin had pneumonia back in '52... now where's my tea?","Oh dearie me... my eyes, you see, they've been quite... red, I'd say for a few days now. Can't really remember when it started, but I think it was after that trip to the farmer's market last week...

And my sinuses, bless my soul, they're all congested and stuffy. Can't seem to breathe properly through my nose anymore... (hesitates) Now what were we talking about again?

Oh dear, I just can't get going in the mornings like I used to... no energy at all. Just feel like a sack of potatoes most days. And this throat of mine, it's been so... itchy. Can't even swallow my morning tea without feeling like I've got sandpaper down there. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw that lovely bird outside my window? Such a beauty! A robin, I think... or was it a sparrow?

Now, where was I? Ah yes, throat! And these lumps on my neck, they're quite... swollen, isn't it? My sister used to have something like that when she got the flu. No, wait, wasn't it pneumonia? (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's all over the place today! Anyway, I'm coughing up a lot of... phlegm, is it called? Can't remember what we're calling those nasty globs these days.

(suddenly becomes distracted) You know, I think I left my reading glasses at the kitchen table. Must go get them..."
68,Common Cold,"My sinuses feel stuffy, and my eyes have been quite red. I simply lack energy, and my throat has been really scratchy. Along with the swelling in my lymph nodes, I've also been coughing up a lot of phlegm.","My sinuses... well, they're stuffy, like usual in the springtime, you know? I swear, it's always something with my sinuses. And my eyes, oh dearie me, they've been quite red, almost like I got some onion in 'em. (chuckles) Remember that time I made that big ol' batch of homemade onion soup for the church potluck? Anyway... (pauses)

Oh, where was I? Ah yes, my sinuses and eyes. And I just feel so tired all the time. Lack of energy, you know? Can't even get myself to do a load of laundry without taking a nap afterwards. (laughs) My husband says I'm getting old, but... (trails off)

My throat's been scratchy too. And these lumps in my neck... they're like big ol' marbles under my skin. Swelling in the lymph nodes, that's what it is. The doctor said something about that last time I saw him... or was it the nurse? Oh dear, my memory's not what it used to be...

And then there's this coughing up phlegm business. Ugh, don't even get me started on that. It's like my body's trying to tell me somethin', but I'm just too stubborn to listen... (trails off)","Oh dearie me... my sinuses, they feel stuffy, ya know? Like a big ol' balloon in there, pressin' on my head. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to that new restaurant downtown? No, no, not now... (chuckles) Where was I? Ah yes, my sinuses.

And my eyes, bless me, they're red as a tomato. I must've gotten some pollen or somethin' in 'em. I swear, I used to be able to walk outside without gettin' all sniffly and whatnot. Now it's like... (pauses, searching for words) Well, it's just not right.

I feel like I'm stuck in the mud, doc. Lacking energy, ya know? Can't even make it through a whole episode of ""The Price is Right"" without needin' a nap. (laughs nervously) Now, what was that other thing... oh yes! My throat's been scratchy as all get out.

And then there's the swelling in my lymph nodes... (trails off) Did I have surgery on those things? No, no, that was my husband... (chuckles) He had some kind of procedure. Anyway, they're swollen, and it hurts to swallow.

Now, let me think for a minute... I've been coughin' up phlegm left and right. It's like... (pauses, searching for an analogy) Well, imagine your pipes are all clogged up, and you need a good plunger... that's what my sinuses feel like. (laughs weakly)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My sinuses. Stuffy, red eyes, scratchy throat, swollen lymph nodes, and this awful coughin' business... (trails off)"
69,Common Cold,"My eyes are always red and itchy, and my nose feels all stuffy and congested. I just feel kind of sick and tired all the time, and I keep coughing up all this gunk.

I just feel kind of sick and tired all the time, and I keep coughing up all this gunk. My throat feels sore and scratchy. Now, where did I put those aspirins? Ah yes, in the cupboard next to... uh... what was I saying? Oh right. The coughing. It's like my chest is all clogged up.

My doctor friend, Tom... or was it Bob? *chuckles* Anyway, he said something about a cold or allergies. But I'm not sure. The bumps on my neck, they're bigger than usual. You know how some days are just one thing after another?","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I don't know what's wrong with me, but my eyes just won't quit itch'n... always red and... (sighs) you know, like when I was a kid and I got allergies from the roses in our backyard?... Ah, yes! Roses. My sister used to tease me 'cause I'd sneeze all the time... (chuckles) anyway...

Now where was I? Oh right, my eyes! They're always red and itchy... and my nose is all stuffy... feels like someone's squeezing it shut... or maybe that's just the sinus pressure from... (pauses) wait, what was I saying about sinus pressure? Ah yes, we went to Florida once for my sister-in-law's anniversary, and oh boy, those hotel rooms were a real treat... (laughs)

Anyway, back to me... (clears throat) My eyes are red, nose is stuffy, I'm always tired... feel like I'm dragging an anchor behind me. And this coughing! Lord have mercy... it's like my lungs are trying to get something outta there. Gunk, that's what I think they call it... (gulps) and my throat feels all scratchy... sore as a raw potato... No, wait, was that a potato? Or was it the tomatoes in my garden last summer? Tomatoes, yes! We had a bumper crop...

Oh, and those bumps on my neck? (pauses) Um, are they supposed to be bigger than usual? I think so. My grandson said something about them... but I swear he's got those bumps too... or is it just the acne from all that pizza eating? Pizza! Now that reminds me... where did we put the recipe for my famous lasagna? (laughs) Oh dear, what was I saying again?"
70,Common Cold,"My nose always feels stuffy and congested, and my eyes are always red and itching. I have a feeling of being unwell and fatigued, and I keep hacking up this gunk. I have a scratchy, irritated throat, and I've seen that my neck's bumps are larger than usual.","Well, doc... I think it's been like this for weeks now? Maybe longer... (pauses) You know, my sister-in-law had something similar last year, but she said it was allergies... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my nose. It feels all stuffy and congested, like a cold or something. And these red eyes, they're driving me crazy! They itch so much. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time at the lake, I got some cayenne pepper in my eye... (laughs) Oh dear, never mind.

Anyway, besides this stuffiness and fatigue, I've been hacking up all sorts of gunk. And my throat... it's just scratchy and irritated. Like sandpaper. Ugh. And have you seen these bumps on my neck? They're getting bigger than usual, if you ask me. (pauses) When was the last time we took my blood pressure again? I think it might be high or something...","Oh dear, I don't know if I'm making any sense... My nose, you see, it's just always stuffy, congested, like a cold but not quite... You know what I mean? It's been that way for weeks now, months maybe... Time flies by so fast these days. (pauses) And my eyes, well, they're red and itching all the time... Like when I used to get allergies back in the 50s... (chuckles) Oh boy, those were the days...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my eyes. It's like someone poured kerosene on 'em or something. And then there's this feeling of being unwell, you know? Fatigued. Like when I had that flu last winter... (pauses) Was it last winter? Or the one before? My memory's not what it used to be... (trails off)

Oh dear me, and then there's the coughing. This gunk just keeps coming up. It's like my lungs are clogged or something. I tried that inhaler thingy you told me about, but I don't know if it's working... (sighs) And my throat, oh my neck... (pauses) The bumps on my neck, they seem larger than usual. I could've sworn I was looking at pictures of myself from when I was younger... (laughs nervously)

Where's my reading glasses? I had them just a minute ago... (rummages through nearby items) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now. What were we talking about again? (pauses, looks confused)"
71,Common Cold,"I keep sneezing, and my eyes don't quit dripping. It's incredibly difficult for me to breathe because it feels like there is something trapped in my throat. I often feel exhausted, and lately, I've had a lot of phlegm. Moreover, my lymph nodes are enlarged.","I keep sneezing, dear... can't seem to stop myself from doing that. And my eyes don't quit dripping, I swear. It's like a faucet won't turn off! (pauses) You know, reminds me of when I was fixing the sink at home, and the pipe burst... oh, dearie me, what was I saying? Ah yes, my breathing. It's incredibly difficult because it feels like there's something trapped in my throat... or maybe that's just my sinuses acting up again. (chuckles) Lately, I've been so exhausted all the time... and phlegm! Good grief, I coughed up a whole lung last night. (giggles) My sister said I must be allergic to something... which reminds me, has it started getting warmer outside? Or is that just the weatherman's wild imagination again? Ah yes, and then there's these... lumps... in my neck. Can't quite remember when they showed up... was it last week or... no, wait, I'm sure I had 'em before that. (pauses) Enlarged lymph nodes, I think I've heard that term somewhere...","I don't know what's going on with me... sneezing all the time, my eyes are runnin' like a faucet... can't stop no matter how many tissues I use... (chuckles) Oh dear, remember that one time I went to the lake and got water up my nose? Lord have mercy, it was a mess! Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, sneezing. And breathin', it's like there's somethin' stuck in my throat, makes it hard to catch my breath. (pauses) Did I tell you about my sister's birthday party last week? We had the most wonderful cake... made with real butter, not that fake stuff... (trails off)

Oh dear, focus! Right, so my breathing. It's all labored and whatnot. And then there's this phlegm business... been coughin' up a storm for weeks now. My husband says it's allergies or somethin', but I'm not so sure. Lymph nodes, yes... (pauses) You know, I used to have those little bumps on my neck when I was a kid, didn't they go away? Or did they just move somewhere else? (chuckles) Oh dear...

You see, I've been feelin' pretty worn out lately, and with this sneezin', droopy eyes, and throat that's all clogged up... well, it's just makin' life a bit of a struggle. Now what was the question again? Or did I already tell you all this? (laughs) Oh dear, my mind's goin' in circles today!"
72,Common Cold,My eyes are red and watery all the time. I've also had this pressure in my sinuses that won't go away. I'm always feeling tired and I've been having a lot of trouble breathing. I've also had a lot of gunk in my throat and my lymph nodes are swollen.,"I've been gettin' this... this problem with my eyes, ya know? They're all red and watery, all the time. Can't even watch TV without tearin' up. And my sinuses, oh boy... I don't know if it's just allergies or what, but I got this pressure in 'em that won't go away. Makes me feel like a balloon about to pop. Anyway, now I'm always tired... (pauses) Did I tell ya I saw the grandkids last week? They were so cute, playin' with their new puppy... (clears throat)

Now where was I? Ah yes, bein' tired all the time. And then there's this breathin' problem I got goin' on. It's like tryin' to breathe through a straw or somethin'. My chest feels tight too. Oh dear, I think I'm gettin' a little mixed up... what day is it today? (chuckles) Anyway, besides all that, my throat's always feelin' clogged and there's this gunk in the back of it. And now I find out my lymph nodes are swollen too! Can't remember when I last had 'em checked, but I'm sure it wasn't recently...","Oh dear... (pauses) My eyes, they're just... (clears throat) you know how it is when you're gettin' older? They just get all... irritated, I suppose. Red and watery all the time. Can't even watch my soap operas no more without feelin' like someone's poured a whole bottle of kerosene in 'em. (chuckles) I swear, Edna from down the street used to say it was her allergies too, but I think she just ate one too many beans... (trails off)

Anyway... this pressure in my sinuses... been feelin' it for weeks now. Like someone's stuck a pin in my forehead and won't let up. Can't even enjoy my tea without it achin'. Now, don't get me wrong, I love tea... Earl Grey's still my favorite... (gets sidetracked) You know, I used to work at the tea shop downtown? Before your time, of course. (pauses) Where was I?

Oh yes, sinuses! And then there's this tiredness... all the time. Can't even make it through bingo night without feelin' like I've run a marathon. Must be gettin' old, just can't catch my breath no more. Like someone's tied an anchor to my chest. (pauses) Wait, was that the Johnsons' boy? No, it was... uh... their cat! Yes, Fluffy had kittens last year...

And this stuff in my throat... just won't go away. Looks like I've been eatin' too much snot, if you ask me. My doctor friend from church said somethin' about ""exudate""... whatever that means. And these lymph nodes of mine? Swollen up like a bunch of old balloons. Can barely swallow my own saliva no more. (exasperated sigh) That's just... (pauses, looks around the room) where did I put my reading glasses?"
73,Common Cold,"My eyes are constantly red and runny. A persistent tightness in my sinuses has also been bothering me. I've been having a lot of difficulties breathing and constantly feel fatigued. In addition, I have a lot of throat mucus and inflamed lymph nodes.","My eyes, you see... they're always red and runny now. Like when I was younger, I used to get them from allergies, but this is different. It's like a pressure, a tightness in my sinuses... (pauses) Oh, speaking of young, have you seen that new cat at the nursing home? My sister says it's very mischievous... (chuckles)

Anyway, breathing's become a problem too. I get winded just walking to the kitchen. And I'm always tired, like my batteries are run down or something. You know how it is when you need a nap after lunch? (laughs) Ah, dear me, what was I saying? Ah yes, throat mucus... so much of it! Like snot on a Kleenex, never-ending. And then there's these swollen things under my neck... lymph nodes, isn't that what they're called?","Oh dear, doctor... (pauses) I'm so sorry, what was that you asked me? Ah yes, my symptoms. Well, it's this eyes, they're always red and runny, like a perpetually drippy faucet. (chuckles) My grandkids say it looks like I've been crying all the time, but I'm not... (pauses again) Wait, was I supposed to take that pill today? No, no, I think you said yesterday.

Anyway, my sinuses, they're always tight, like a drum. Drums, you know how those things are? (trails off) We used to have one at the community center... Oh, right! The symptoms. So, my sinuses are all tight and it's hard for me to breathe. I feel like I'm always tired, like an old cat on a hot porch. (chuckles)

And then there's this mucus... Lord have mercy, I don't know what I'd do without my Neti pot. It's like my nose is just a big ol' sponge, soaking up all the yuckiness in the air. And these lumps... (points to neck) My lymph nodes, they're always inflamed. You see that? (pauses for a moment) Now, where did I put my tea cup?

Now, what was it you were saying about my eyes again? Ah yes, red and runny. That's the important part. (smiling) And don't even get me started on this fatigue... I swear, I'm like a car that won't start sometimes. (laughs)"
74,Common Cold,"My nose feels quite clogged, and my eyes are constantly very red and runny. In addition, my chest hurts and I've been having a lot of breathing problems. In addition, my muscles feel quite painful, and I can't smell anything.","Oh dear doctor... my nose feels quite clogged, you know? Like when I was a young girl and had that cold in '47, it lasted for weeks... (pauses) My eyes are constantly very red and runny, I don't know what's causing it. In addition, my chest hurts, and I've been having a lot of breathing problems lately. I think I remember you telling me something about asthma? Was it last week or the week before? (chuckles) Oh dear... anyway... my muscles feel quite painful, especially in my back, and I just can't smell anything. It's like my sense of smell has gone missing! Just like when we lost our dog, Rufus... (trails off)","You know, doc... (pauses) My nose feels quite clogged, yes, that's right. Can't breathe out of it proper like. And my eyes, oh boy, they're always red and runny now. Reminds me of when I was a kid, got a cold and couldn't play outside for days... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, the nose.

Now, let's see... I've been having some trouble with my chest too. It hurts, doc. Hurts when I breathe in deep or cough. And it's hard to catch my breath, you know? Like when I'm walking up them stairs at home and I have to stop halfway up... (pauses) You know what, I think we had a new washing machine then? (giggles) Ahem, anyway...

And the pain in my muscles. Lord have mercy, it's like someone's taken a hammer to 'em! Can't move without wincing, if you know what I mean. It started after that car ride with my sister last week... or was it two weeks ago? (laughs) Wait, no, no, I'm getting mixed up now...

But the worst part, doc... (pauses for emphasis) I can't smell a thing! Nothing's got any scent to it anymore. My coffee smells like water, and don't even get me started on my wife's cooking... (chuckles) Oh dearie me, excuse me... Ah yes, the not being able to smell... That's just awful, doc. Awful."

Can't remember if I told you about that already, though... or was it last week? (chuckles) Don't mind me, just gettin' old... anyway... 

My breathing's been a bit off too - hard to catch a deep breath, like someone's got their hand on my chest. And the pain in my chest... (pauses, searching for words) you know, it's like when I used to work at the factory and we'd have those dust mask things on? Like that, but without the dust... (trails off) Ah yes, and I can barely smell anything now. Don't even get me started on my muscles... they just ache all over, poor me...","I don't know if I should've had that extra slice of pie for breakfast...

I swear, it's been like this since we moved to that new neighborhood last year... or was it five years ago? Time flies when you're having fun, don't it?

Now, about these breathing difficulties... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! Breathing. It's hard to get a full breath in now. My chest hurts, too. Not like my grandchild's cough last winter, but more... more of a tightness. Like someone's sitting on it. (laughs) Silly thought, isn't it?

And speaking of silly things... I just remembered we had the most wonderful garden party this summer! The flowers were blooming everywhere... (trails off) Oh dear, what was the point of that story? Ah yes, the smell. Or lack thereof. It's like someone poured sand in my nose. I can't smell anything anymore. And my muscles, well, they ache all over. Like when I used to garden for hours on end... (chuckles wistfully) Those were the days...

Now, what was it we were talking about again? Oh yes! The red eyes and runny nose. (laughs) I hope you can help me with that, dear doctor..."
76,Common Cold,"My eyes are usually red and inflamed, and I have the impression that something is clogging my sinuses. I've been coughing up a lot of gunk, and my chest hurts.

It's like my lungs are tryin' to expel a bunch of gunk... (pauses) Now what was for dinner last night? Wasn't that nice chicken? Oh, yes! The chest pain, doc. It's been goin' on for days now. I can hardly smell nothin', and my muscles ache somethin' fierce...""","Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah... my eyes, they're always red and puffy, like when I was a kid and got that bad allergy.

Oh yeah, my sinuses. They feel all congested and achy.

Now, I've been coughin' a lot, lots of mucus... yuck! (shudders) And this chest pain... it's like someone's pressin' on it from the inside out. No, no, it's more like... you know when your appendix hurts? That's what this feels like.

But the weird thing is, I can barely smell a thing. My wife says I'm cookin' dinner and I forget to add salt or somethin', but I swear I did put some in. (laughs) Ah, dear me! And then there's my muscles... ( winces) they ache like after a long walk on the beach.

Let me think for a sec... was it last week when this started? Or was it before that? (scratches head) Hmm... anyway, I'm tellin' ya, Doc—no, not you, someone else..."

Anyway, doc, the coughin'. It's been comin' in waves, like a stormy sea. All this goo I'm coughin' up... it's just awful. And my chest, it feels so heavy, like someone's put a weight on me. Can't even smell nothin', not even when I'm cookin' dinner. Now, what was the name of that new medication for allergies? Oh dear, I know I wrote it down somewhere...

I'm not sure if I should've come in today, but my eyes have been lookin' like two red peppers for weeks now...

They're always puffy and it's hard to see the TV without feelin' like a fog is rollin' in.

And then there's this stuff blockin' up my sinuses, you know how that feels? (hesitates) Like my nose is plugged up with Play-Doh or somethin'. I swear, I had a recipe for homemade Play-Doh once... must've been from my sister. Good Lord, where did it go?

Coughin's gettin' worse too. It's like my chest is fillin' up with wet cement all the time. And this goo – (coughs) excuse me – I cough up more of it than a cat sheds hair!

Wait, what were we talkin' about? Ah yes, my muscles. They ache somethin' fierce – must've pulled 'em liftin' that garden chair outta the shed last week... (chuckles) Now where's that garden chair gone?

Where was I? Ah yes, not bein' able to smell nothin'. It's like my nose is just... numb. And these aches in my muscles, they're gettin' so bad I feel like I've been lifted up by the wind and set down again. Or maybe it's just this new mattress we got?

(pauses again) Oh dear, I'm getting a bit mixed up... anyway, and then there's this muscle aching all over... my back especially...","I'm not feelin' too good, doc... been like this for days now... (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I went fishin' with my grandkids? We caught us a big ol' bass, and they were so excited... anyway...

My cough's been terrible, just nonstop, you know? And this cold, it's got me feeling all stuffed up. My sinuses are clogged somethin' awful, and I've got pressure in my face, right here (taps forehead). It's like someone's squeezin' my head, if you can imagine that.

Now, the coughin', it's gettin' on my nerves... I mean, I'm coughin' up all sorts of stuff. Mucus, that's what they call it, right? Yeah, just a mess. And my chest... (pauses) Oh, wait, where did I put those pictures from the garden party last summer?

Oh yes, my chest... it pains me somethin' fierce when I cough. Like someone's kickin' in there or somethin'. Can't catch my breath... you know how it is.

And smellin'? Forget about it! (chuckles) I mean, I can smell a little bit of coffee in the mornin', but that's about it. My nose just isn't workin' right now. And these muscles... achy's not even the word for it. I feel like I've been run over by a truck or somethin'. 

(pauses, lost in thought) Now, what was it we were talkin' about again?"
81,Common Cold,"My cough and cold have been awful for days. My sinuses are congested, and my face is under strain. Additionally, I've been coughing up phlegm, and it hurts in my chest. I have no sense of smell, and my muscles hurt a lot.","""Oh dearie me... my cough and cold have been just awful for days now... I'm not sure if it's been two weeks or three, but it feels like an eternity. My sinuses are all clogged up, you know? And my face, it's like someone's put a big ol' bandage on it. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time my neighbor, uh, what was her name again... Mabel? Maude? Ah yes, Mabel! She had a similar thing happen to her last year.

Anyway, I've been coughing up phlegm like there's no tomorrow. And it hurts in my chest, Lord have mercy. Can't even catch my breath sometimes. No sense of smell at all, that's just not right. (pauses) Now where did I put my tea? Ah yes... and my muscles hurt a lot too. Tired all the time...""","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, doc... I don't know if I should be here... (pauses) Oh dear, my sinuses have been actin' up somethin' fierce for days now... Can't smell a thing! That's the truth, not even the coffee, and I love me some good coffee. (chuckles)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my face, it feels all squished, like there's pressure or somethin'. Don't know if that's normal, but it's quite uncomfortable. Now, my cough... Lord have mercy, it's been goin' on for ages. Phlegm, they call it, phlegm... always coughin' up a lung, I swear. (gulps)

My chest, oh dearie me, it hurts somethin' awful when I breathe in deep. Must be my lungs, I reckon. Or maybe it's just old age gettin' to me. (laughs) You know what they say: ""use it or lose it."" Well, I'm tryin' to use mine, but... (trails off)

Muscles hurt a lot too, I find myself gettin' tired easier than I used to. Must be all this... (pauses, looking for the right words) ...this sinus stuff. That's what it is! Sinus trouble. My grandma used to have that, she'd always say... (starts to ramble about her grandmother)

Oh, sorry 'bout that, doc... just gettin' old and scatterbrained, I guess. Just wanted to mention my symptoms... you know, the usual: coughin', phlegm, no smell... hope you can help me with this mess!"
82,Common Cold,"I'm coughing nonstop and I'm shivering terribly. I have a stuffy nose and my face is under strain. In addition, my throat is coughing up some nasty gunk, and my chest hurts. My muscles hurt a lot, and I can't smell anything.","I'm coughin' nonstop, doc... and I'm shiverin' somethin' awful. Can't seem to catch my breath. Got a stuffy nose, ya know? Been feelin' like this for... um... a while now, I think it's been three days or so? Maybe four? Anyway, my face is all strained, lookin' like a prune, I swear. And the coughin', oh boy... it's coughin' up some pretty nasty gunk in my throat. My chest hurts somethin' fierce, too. And them muscles of mine, they're killin' me. Can't even smell nothin'! You know what I had for lunch today? A nice tuna sandwich... at least, I think it was Tuesday?","I'm coughin', Lord have mercy, nonstop like a steam engine, can't catch my breath... and shiverin' so bad I thought I'd lose me coat last night... or was it this mornin'? Ah, yes, shiverin'. And my nose, bless its soul, is all stuffed up like a faucet turned off. Face feels all pressed in too, like someone took a vise to it. 

Now, let me think... what else? Oh yes, that nasty business in the back of me throat. Coughin' up this gunk, it's just gross. My chest, I swear, hurts somethin' fierce. And them muscles, Lordy, they ache like when I used to shovel coal at the factory. Used to be a young whippersnapper, you know... (chuckles) Ah, yes... where was I? Ah yes, my muscles. Don't seem to have much strength in 'em neither.

Can't smell nothin', that's what I'm sayin'. Not like when I used to garden, all them flowers and fresh air... Now, I think it was Tuesday, I went out for groceries... or was it Wednesday? Oh dearie me, what's the matter with my memory these days? 

Anyway, can't smell nothin' now. My poor head feels all muddled, like when I took that wrong turn on Elm Street. But that's beside the point! Just need somethin' for this cough, if you please..."
83,Common Cold,I can't stop coughing and I feel really cold. My sinuses are all blocked and I have a lot of mucus. My chest hurts and I can't smell anything. My muscles are also really sore.,"You know, Doc... I don't know if it's the weather, but I just can't stop coughin'. And I feel like I'm freezin' my tail off. My sinuses are all blocked up, and Lord have mercy, there's so much mucus in there... (pauses) You know what they had at the cafeteria yesterday? These little sandwiches with egg salad... anyway...

My chest hurts somethin' fierce, and I swear, I can barely breathe. And don't even get me started on my sense of smell – it's gone, like a mousehole in the wall... (chuckles) Reminds me, what was the name of that park we used to take walks in? You know, with all the walking paths... Ah, bother...

Now, where was I? Oh yes, my muscles. They're all sore and achy, like when I tried to lift them heavy boxes at the garage sale last week... (pauses) Wait, what time is it? I think I got up too early this morning... (trails off)

You see, Doc, like I was sayin', I just can't seem to shake this cold... or whatever it is. It's got me in a bit of a pickle... (hesitates)","You know, I just can't seem to stop coughin'. It's been like this for days now... weeks? No, no, I'm pretty sure it's longer than that. Anyway, I feel just awful. So cold all the time... my joints ache somethin' fierce. Must be from the gardenin', I was out there rakin' leaves last weekend and got soaked to the bone.

Sinuses are actin' up, too. Can't breathe through my nose at all. Mucus everywhere! I swear, it's like a faucet turned on inside me head. (chuckles) My husband says I must have allergies or somethin', but I'm thinkin' it's this cold that just won't quit.

Now, where did I put those pills? Ah yes, my chest... hurts to breathe deep. And don't even get me started on smellin'. Can't catch a whiff of nothin'. My grandkids were cookin' up some chili last week and the whole house was filled with that wonderful aroma... but I didn't notice it at all. Must be my sinuses, I reckon.

Muscles feel like I just finished runnin' a marathon or somethin'. Sore all over. And them coughs... (coughs) Excuse me! Just the other day, I was talkin' to our neighbor, and she said her sister's cousin had some sort of flu that sounded suspiciously like what I've got now. Now, what was it called? Ah yes, something with ""H"" in it..."
84,Common Cold,"I'm coughing nonstop and am really chilly. My mucus production is excessive, and my sinuses are fully clogged. I can't smell anything, and my chest hurts. My muscles are quite painful as well.","I'm coughin' nonstop and I'm really chilly... even with the heat on in here. My mucus production is excessive, you know? Can't even begin to tell you how much... (pauses) You know, my grandson was over last week, playing his trumpet... (trails off) 

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my sinuses are fully clogged. Can't smell a thing. My wife always says, ""You can't smell the cookies baking when you got a cold like that."" (chuckles) Reminds me of when we first met, at the church potluck... 

Oh dear, what's today? Is it Wednesday? Anyway... I had to take some medication this morning, but now my chest hurts. Muscles too, actually. Quite painful. (pauses, looks around) Did I mention I saw the nice lady from the neighborhood association? Always so cheerful...","(clears throat) Oh dearie me... I'm coughin' nonstop, bless my soul. Can't seem to catch a breath, you know? Feels like I've got a cold... or is it the flu? (pauses) Wait, what was I talkin' about again? Ah yes, my sinuses. They're all clogged up, won't budge at all. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I had to clear out the pipes in our old house... (trails off)

Oh dear, anyway... My mucus production is excessive, don't you know? More snot than a wet sock in a laundry basket! (laughs) And my chest hurts somethin' awful. Can barely take a deep breath without feelin' like I'm gonna collapse. Muscles ache too, you see. Like when I pulled that tendon... what was it, '48? No, no, not that one, the other one... (scratches head) Oh dear.

My sinuses are clogged, and my nose is all stuffed up. Can't smell a thing! (pauses) Now, where's my tea? I swear I left it right here on the... Ah, yes, the doctor's office. (chuckles) Never mind that. My chest hurts somethin' fierce, like someone's stuck a knife in there and turned the handle. Coughin', coughin', can't stop!"
85,Common Cold,"I can't stop coughing and I'm freezing. My sinuses are completely blocked, and I'm inundated with mucous. My chest hurts, and I'm unable to smell anything. My muscles are also really achy.","You know, I'm so sorry I'm keepin' you waitin', I think I might've gotten my appointment times mixed up... (chuckles) Anyway, I'm havin' a right ol' time with this cough of mine. Just can't seem to shake it, and I'm feelin' like I'm stuck in the icebox. My sinuses are all clogged up, I swear I've been blowin' my nose for hours, but nothin's changin'. And let me tell you, there's so much snot... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, it's just comin' out in rivers. My chest hurts somethin' fierce too... and the smell? Fuggetaboutit! I mean, we had the most delicious roast chicken for dinner last night, but now... nothin'. And to make matters worse, my muscles ache like someone's been poundin' on me with a hammer.","I don't know what's gotten into me... (pauses) My grandkids came over last night, you know. They had that new video game... I think they were playin' it on my Xbox? (chuckles) I swear, that thing's more complicated than a Swiss watch...

Anyway, about this cough... (clears throat) It just won't quit! And the cold? Shoot, I'm freezin' here. My sinuses are all clogged up like a drain in the bathtub. (pauses) You know what's funny? When we were kids, we didn't have all these new-fangled medicines... We'd drink some hot tea or cider and that was it.

Nowadays, it seems like everyone's always talkin' about this one thing or another... (trails off) Oh, right! My sinuses. They're all blocked up. And the mucus? It's just comin' outta my nose like a faucet. (pauses to blow nose) Ah, pardon me...

And then there's this chest pain... (hesitates) I don't know if it's related or not, but I've been feelin' kinda off for a while now. Can't smell nothin', either. (looks around the room) Now, where did I put my keys? Ah, yes... My muscles are all achy, too. I think it's just this cold, though. Must be.

(starts to ramble) We went to Florida last winter and... (stops abruptly) Wait a minute! What were we talkin' about again?"
86,Common Cold,"I've been coughing a lot and finding it difficult to breathe. My throat hurts and I feel like I have a lot of phlegm trapped in my chest. My nose has been running a lot, and I've been feeling really congested.","""Ah, doc... I've been coughin' somethin' fierce for weeks now, can't seem to catch my breath. This darn throat of mine is killin' me, all achy and sore. And don't even get me started on this phlegm in my chest, feels like it's stuck there forever! My nose has been drippin' like a faucet, too... I swear, I've gone through an entire box of tissues already this month. Now, what was I tellin' you about? Ah yes, the congestion... that's been with me for ages now. You know, reminds me of when my cousin Edna came down with pneumonia last winter... she said it was a real doozy. Oh dear, what's that word I'm thinkin' of... (pauses) Anyway, like I said, doc...""","Wait, what was the question again? Oh, my symptoms? Ah, yes! I've been coughin' a lot, can't catch my breath at all. Feels like someone's got their hand around my neck. And this throat of mine... (pauses) You know, I had the most wonderful chicken soup for lunch today, reminded me of my mother's cookin'. (chuckles)

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Throat hurts somethin' awful. Like someone poured acid in there. And this phlegm, it's like... (pauses) You know, when you're a kid and you get that stuff stuck in your chest? Yeah, like that. Can't seem to cough it up no matter what I do.

Now my nose... (coughs) excuse me! My nose's been runnin' somethin' fierce. Must've used up half the tissues in the box already. And this congestion, it's like... (pauses again) Wasn't I just tellin' you about that time we went to the beach and the fog rolled in? Ah, no, not now, let me think...

Anyway! Congestion's been awful. Feels like someone poured a bucket of water down my throat and it won't clear up no matter what I do. Now, where did I put those... (pauses once more) Oh dear, what was the question again?"
87,Common Cold,"I've been quite exhausted and ill. My throat has been quite painful, and I've had a fairly nasty cough. I've got a lot of chills and a pretty high temperature. Just feeling extremely run down and weak","I've been feelin' just terrible, doc... no, I mean... for days now? Or was it weeks? Oh dear, I get confused sometimes. Anyway, I'm exhausted, just plumb tuckered out. My throat's been killin' me - it hurts to swallow, you know? And this cough! Lord have mercy, it's been goin' on forever... or so it feels. Chills and sweats, all the time. Temperature's up high, I'm sure of that. Just feel like a wet noodle, all weak and limp. You know what reminded me of when I was a girl? My sister had the flu just like this, back in '52... or was it '53? No matter, anyway... where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms... (pauses)","Well, doc... I don't know if this is what it is, but... (pauses) Excuse me, what was that noise? Oh, never mind. Anyway, I've been feelin' just awful for days now. Can't seem to catch my breath, and my throat's been killin' me. Painful, you know? Like someone's scratchin' it with a file or somethin'. (chuckles) No, that's not right... never mind.

I've had this cough... uh... I think it started after we had that big snowstorm last week. You remember the one where all the lights went out for three hours? My grandkids were over, and they got so scared... anyway... this cough. It's been gettin' worse every day. And these chills, oh boy! Can't seem to warm up no matter how many blankets I use.

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the temperature. It's been... (pauses) 102? No, it's not just that. I'm sure of it. Got a thermometer somewhere in this house... now where did I put it? Oh, never mind. I'll get it later.

And feelin' run down... weak like an old sock or somethin'. Just don't have the energy for nothin'. (sighs) Don't know what's goin' on with me. Maybe I just need a good rest and some of that chicken soup my wife used to make? You know, the one with all those vegetables in it... or was that a different recipe? (trails off)"
88,Common Cold,"I've been experiencing severe weariness and a sickly sensation. My throat has been really painful and I've had a fairly severe cough. My nose has been quite stuffy, and I've had significant sinus pressure. I'm really miserable and extremely exhausted.","Doc... you know what's funny? Yesterday I was out in my garden and I saw that squirrel again, the one with the red tail. Always chasing after the birds... anyway... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I start?

I've been feeling just dreadful lately. This weariness, it's like a weight on me. Can't even get up from the couch without getting winded. And this cough, Lord have mercy! It feels like my throat's gonna burst into flames every time I try to talk. My nose is all stuffy too... no, not just stuffy, congested. Congested, that's it.

You know, I think it started after I had dinner at the Johnsons' last week? Or was it a few days ago? (chuckles) Oh dear, it's all blurring together now... My sinus pressure is through the roof! It feels like someone's squeezing my head in vice grips. Miserable doesn't even begin to describe how I'm feeling these days... just exhausted, exhausted, exhausted.","You know, doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' just terrible lately. Just so... tired all the time. No energy at all. (coughs) Excuse me, sorry about that. Anyway, my throat... it's just killin' me. Hurts to swallow, hurts to talk... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I saw a bird in our backyard? It was so beautiful... (chuckles)

Oh, right! My symptoms. So, I've been gettin' this cough, and it's just awful. Keeps me up at night, too. Can't sleep with all that hackin' goin' on. (pauses) Now, let me think for a sec... what was the question again? Ah yes, my nose. It's all stuffy, like someone poured cement in there. And my sinuses... well, they're just as bad. Pressure, pain... you name it.

Now, I know I'm not gettin' any younger, but this is somethin' else. (laughs) I remember when I was your age... we didn't have all these new-fangled medicines and whatnot. We just took care of ourselves, if you know what I mean. (trails off) Did I ever tell you about the time I won a prize for my vegetable garden? It was at the county fair...

Anyway, I'm just miserable, doc. Miserable is the word. Can't do nothin' without feelin' like I'm gonna collapse or somethin'. (coughs again) Oh dear... I think I might need some of them cough drops now that I'm talkin' so much...

Oh, and one more thing! My tongue feels all funny when I swallow. Like it's got sandpaper on it or somethin'. (stares off into space for a moment) Now, where did I put my reading glasses?"
89,Common Cold,I've been feeling really sick and I've had a lot of fatigue. I've had a really bad cough and my throat has been really sore.

Can't remember if it started last week or two weeks ago... didn't go out much this week, so maybe it was just my imagination. Anyway, I've had a lot of fatigue, you see.

(pauses) oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my throat's been sore as can be. Sinus pressure too. My nose is all congested. All the time. It's like someone's poured glue in there.

Ah yes, this cough of mine. It's just awful. My throat's all sore and scratchy... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I went to the beach in '52? We were all having a picnic and... (stops suddenly)

Oh, right. The cough. So, it started a few weeks ago. And I've been feeling so tired, just running on fumes, you know? Can't even make it through the day without needing a nap. I'm starting to think maybe I'm getting old or something. (chuckles) I mean, I was fine when I was working... (pauses) Wait, where's my reading glasses?

Anyway, the cough's been really bad at night. It wakes me up and I just can't catch my breath. And this sinus pressure? Lord have mercy, it feels like someone's got a vice grip on my head. My nose is all stuffy too... (pauses to sniffle) Ah-choo! Excuse me.

Now, where was I going with this? Oh yes, the doctor I saw last week said something about allergies. But I'm pretty sure it's not that. I mean, I've never had any problems like this before. Unless... unless it's that thing my cousin's husband got a few years back. Wasn't it some kind of pneumonia or something? (starts to ramble)"

(pauses) You know, I had the most wonderful time at the garden club meeting last week...I won first prize for my hydrangeas. But anyway...(chuckles) Ah yes, the cough. It's been awful, like a big ol' elephant is sitting on my chest. And these chills... Lord have mercy! They've got me shivering like a leaf. (hesitates) Um...doctors call it what now? Oh yes, fever!

And the chills, Lord have mercy, they got me shivering like a leaf. My temperature's been quite high, if you know what I mean.

I was thinking about my cousin Edna's husband... (pauses again) Now, where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. Anyway, as I was saying, the fever's left me feeling just drained. Like when I used to help with the garden and get all this pollen on me. Ugh, don't even get me started.

I think it's been going on for... (pauses once more) ...weeks? Months maybe? Time doesn't seem so relevant right now. My memory's not what it used to be, if you know what I mean. All these pills I'm taking, they must be doing something. Unless... unless this is just part of aging. Like when my back started aching and I thought I'd pulled it out. But no, the doctor said it was arthritis.

Anyway, as I was saying... (pauses once more) Oh dear, what's that noise? Must be the heating system. So, like I said, I'm feeling rather feeble. Not myself at all. Just a bag of bones with no energy left in me."

Been taking my thermometer with me everywhere, but it always seems to be stuck in the drawer... Ugh, anyway. My fever's been running high, probably around 102? Maybe higher? Can't quite remember... just feels like I've got a flu or something. Run down, that's all.","I'm so glad I finally remembered to make an appointment, dear me...

(hesitates) Ah, yes! My sister had something similar last year, but she said it was just allergies. You know how it is when you're getting older, your body gets more sensitive... 

Oh dear, I remember now – I did go out for dinner with the ladies from church on Thursday, and we all shared the same chicken soup. Maybe that's where I got this... (trails off) What was I saying? Ah yes! The fever. It's quite high, I think. My thermometer said... umm... 102? Or is it 103? No matter, it's too hot, if you ask me.

Now, where was I? Oh yes, the tiredness! It's been going on for weeks now... (stares off into space) You know, I used to be able to keep up with the garden work without breaking a sweat. Now, it feels like an elephant is sitting on my shoulders all day long... (sighs)

So, I got this congestion, you see... it's like a big ol' fog in my head. And my nose is runnin' like a faucet! Can't stop it, no matter how many tissues I use... (mumbles to self) Tissues, tissues...

And then there's the coughin'. Lord have mercy, it's like my chest is gonna give out on me! Chest pain, that's what they call it, right? (pauses, lost in thought) Wait, didn't I used to work with someone named... uh... Bob? No, no, focus, dearie!

Anyway, the fever... boy, it's been up there for days. I swear, it's like my body's just runnin' a fever, if you know what I mean. (giggles) Get it? Runnin'? Like my nose is runnin', too...

And them muscles! Oh dear heavens, they're achin' somethin' fierce! It's like I got the rheumatism or something... (looks around room) Now, where did I put that pen? Uh-oh, and what was the other thing I wanted to tell you about?

Oh yes! My friend Edna's cat. She was dyin', poor thing... but it wasn't related to this, no sirree. Just a nice story about Edna's cat..."
94,Common Cold,"My neck is swollen, and I'm exhausted. My throat is scratchy, and my eyes are burning red. My nose is really clogged, and I am experiencing facial pressure. My chest hurts, and I'm unable to smell anything.","""Doc... (pauses) excuse me, is your name... uh... Dr. Smith? I think that's right... (chuckles) Ah, yes! So, my neck, it's all swollen like a balloon, and I'm plumb tuckered out. Can't sleep, no sirree... too much caffeine in my tea, I reckon. Throat's as rough as sandpaper, scratchy and whatnot. My eyes, oh dearie me, they're as red as... well, tomatoes! (laughs) And my nose, it's all stopped up like a faucet with the water turned off. Can't breathe through there at all... makes me feel like I've got a cold in here somewhere... (taps forehead) or was it last week? Ah, anyway... my chest hurts too... don't know if that's related or what. And let me tell you, I couldn't smell the coffee this morning... and I love my coffee!""","I don't know if this is what it is, but... my neck, you see... it's all swollen like a balloon or somethin'. And I'm just so tired, exhausted, my body feels like lead, ya know? (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I used to take my grandkids fishing on the lake? We caught us a big ol' bass one summer...

But anyway... (coughs) My throat's been scratchin', itchy-like. And these eyes, they're all red and puffy. My husband says it's just allergies, but I know it's more than that. (pauses again) Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes, here they are... (adjusts glasses)

My nose is stuffed up like a cork, can't breathe outta it nohow. And then there's this pressure in my face... feels like someone's got a fist to my forehead. (taps forehead) You know how sometimes you get these sinus headaches? This is somethin' like that.

Now I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but... (pauses once more) I had the most peculiar dream last night. I was at my sister's wedding... no, wait, it was a funeral... anyway... (chuckles) Oh dear, sorry 'bout that...

And I got this pain in my chest, feels like someone's pressin' down on me. Now, I'm not one to complain, but I just can't smell anything anymore... (looks around the room) Do you have some fresh air or somethin'?"

My eyes are all red and... (taps on armrest) wait, where was I? Ah yes! Red, that's right. And my throat, it feels all scratchy, like when I got that sore throat last winter... or was it spring? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old...

My nose is clogged somethin' fierce, can barely breathe outta there... and this pressure in my face? It's like someone's squeezin' me from the inside out. (taps on knee) You know what they say: ""You are what you eat""... I've been eatin' plenty of veggies lately, though. Can't smell a thing, either. It's like my nose is... well, I don't know how to describe it...

And then there's this... ache in my chest. (takes a deep breath) Like someone's put their hand on me and is holdin' it there. (pauses again) Oh! The park yesterday... that boy with the dog, he was such a nice fella..."

And these lymph nodes, they're all swollen like... like... uh, you know when you swallow too much air? Yeah, that's what they feel like. Enlarged, doc says. Must be from that chicken I had last week. Or was it the fish?

My eyes, dear Lord... burning like a thousand suns! Can't even watch my soap operas no more. And this throat of mine... (coughs) Ah, pardon me. Hurts to swallow, hurts to talk. Like someone's got a grip on my Adam's apple.

Now, sinuses... always been a problem, but lately, it's like I'm stuck in a perpetual sneeze. Can't catch my breath, you know? And this stuffy nose! (sniffles) Reminds me of when I was a young lass, visiting the countryside with my aunt. We'd walk for miles and get all sorts of dust up our noses.

Can't smell a thing! Not even that lovely fresh-baked bread from the bakery down the street. Now, what was I saying? Oh yes, it's been a week or two... ever since I... uh... (pauses) Wait, where did I put my reading glasses?

Chest hurts too, doc. Can't breathe easy, if you know what I mean. Like someone's sitting on me. Ah, but that's just an old person's imagination, isn't it? (chuckles weakly)"

But it don't feel like it's flyin' right now.

Anyway... my face, it's just tired. Can't focus no more. And them sinuses, oh boy! They're clogged up somethin' fierce. I'm like a faucet that won't turn off! (laughs) My husband always says I'm like a leaky faucet. (pauses) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, my chest... it hurts. All this phlegm, you see, and I just can't seem to cough it up good enough. It's like tryin' to get a hair outta your sock! (giggles)

Now, where's my tea? I think I left it in the other room. (pauses) Wait, what was the question again? Oh yes, symptoms. My nose, it don't smell nothin'. Not even coffee! (laughs) And them muscles... Lord have mercy! They're all achy and sore. Like when I used to work in the garden. (starts reminiscing) We'd till for hours on end... my cousin Edna would always say...

(sighs) Sorry, what was I talkin' about again? Ah yes, symptoms. Like I said, it's been a while since this started. Must be one of them nasty viruses goin' 'round.

(yawns) Excuse me, it just comes on outta nowhere. One minute I'm doin' just fine, the next I'm plumb tuckered out. Lymph nodes, too... they're all swollen like big ol' knots. Irritated, is what I'd say. Like someone's playin' a stringed instrument right behind my ears!

Oh dearie me! And them throat mucus... (gulps) It's like someone poured water into my chest and it just won't drain out. Water, yes... we went to the lake house last year and I got water up my nose and... (trails off) Oh yes, now I remember! The neighbor's cat had a haircut that summer too! (laughs) Lord have mercy!

It's like someone put a plug in there and won't take it out.

My chest feels... heavy. That's the word. Heavy as a rock. And this coughin', Lord have mercy. It's like my lungs are tryin' to cough up somethin' that's been stuck down there for years. (pauses) I had a cousin, Ethel, she was always talkin' about her sinuses too... (trails off)

What was the question again? Oh right, symptoms. So, I got no sense of smell either. Not a whiff. It's like my nose is just... asleep or somethin'. And these muscles, doc... they ache so bad. Like I'm 80 years old all over again. (chuckles) Get off my lawn! No, serious though... what's the name of that thing? You know, when your muscles hurt so bad you can't even move 'em?

Where was I? Ah yes, the chills. And then there's the tiredness... (sighs) Lord have mercy, I'm so tired all the time. Can barely get outta bed in the mornin'. My granddaughter said I should see a doctor 'bout my iron levels... or is it my thyroid? Ugh, my mind's a mess these days...

Now, about this cough of mine... (coughs) Ah-choo! Oh dear me, pardon me... (coughs again) Anyway, like I was sayin', the cough. It hurts somethin' fierce in my chest... and when I hack it up, it's all rusty-colored. Not that I'm one to judge, but I remember my great-aunt used to get pneumonia a lot... or was it pleurisy? No, no, that can't be right...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my chest pain. It's been quite sharp, doctor... or nurse. Sharp pains in the middle of my chest, and it radiates all the way down to my back. Just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm going to pass out. (pauses again) You know, I remember when my sister had that same kind of pain... no, wait, she had it in her arm. That's right! She had a pulled muscle or something.

Anyway, as I was saying, the coughing has been relentless. And the phlegm... (hesitates) Well, it's not exactly yellow, but more like... reddish? Is that what they call it when it's red and bloody-like? Oh dear, I hope I'm not being too graphic.

And then there's this exhaustion business. I feel like I've been up all night every night for weeks now. My heart, it's racing like a rabbit! (giggles) You know, my grandma used to have a rabbit that would run around in circles. Poor thing... (trails off)

Oh dear me, where was I? Ah yes, the exhaustion. And this chilliness... (shivers) It's as if someone turned the air conditioning up to full blast while I'm sitting right here! I swear, it's like my body's gone numb.

Where was I? Oh right! Chest hurts when I cough. Like someone's stabbin' me with a knife. (laughs nervously) My heart's racin', too. I'm gettin' the vapors, for sure. Or is it gas? No, no... it's my heart, all right. (pauses again)

You know what was funny? Last week, I saw an old friend from high school, and we were talkin' about... uh... what was his name... Ed! Yeah, Ed Wilson. Anyway... We talked 'bout the weather for like half an hour. Then I forgot why I was visitin' him in the first place. (chuckles) Good times...

Make hot cocoa with marshmallows... Mmm... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I?

They're all rusty brown now. Like them old pennies I used to save in my piggy bank. You know, before they were... (pauses, lost in thought)

Rusty... just like my car, too. Needs a good washin' and waxin'. (chuckles) Oh, wait! I remember now! Them mucus things are the same color as them rusty nails on my husband's old toolbox! He always said... (trails off) Ah, well...

Beautiful weather, just wonderful... Now, where was I? Oh yes, my cough. It hurts when I cough... right here (taps chest). And have you seen this mucus? Gross! Brownish color like old coffee grounds. My son said it's probably just a cold or allergies... but what if it's not? What if it's something more?

Anyway, as I was saying, I have a high fever, really high. Must've been 102, maybe higher? Can't rightly remember what the thermometer said last time. Had it at home, but couldn't find it now... Think I mighta thrown it away by mistake... Ah dear...

Trouble breathing, you see. That's what's bothering me most. It feels like there's a weight on my chest all the time. And the sweating! Good heavens, I'm dripping wet from head to toe. But at the same time, I feel cold as ice. My daughter says it's hypothermia or something... Don't know about that...

And my heart! Oh boy, it's beating like a drum in there. Can feel it in my chest and my neck too. Must be doing some good for my circulation, right? Ha ha!

Now let me think for a sec... What else was I going to tell you? Ah yes, the brownish sputum! Been coughing up that stuff all day yesterday. Didn't think much of it at first, but now it's getting worrisome. Guess I should've gone to the doctor sooner...

And sweatin', Lord have mercy, I'm sweatin' like a pig! My nightgown's stuck to me all day long. My granddaughter said I looked like I'd been swimmin'. (chuckles) Water, yeah, we need some water around here... where's that bottle of water?

Fatigue? Is that what it's called? I feel like I've been runnin' a marathon. No, no, not just tired, more than that. My bones ache all over, and my joints hurt somethin' awful. Chilly? That's right! I'm freezin' to death. Now where did I put my sweater?

My heart... (pauses) it's like my grandma used to say, ""Racing like a jackrabbit!"" I got that same feelin'. My chest is poundin', and I can hear it beatin' in my ears. What's the word for when your heart beats too fast? Ah, yes! Tachycardia... I think.

As for sweating, it's like a faucet turned on full blast. And chills, oh boy! My whole body is shaking like a leaf. (pauses) What was I saying? Oh yes, the chills. It's so hard to explain... and my heart, it's racing like a runaway train! I just want to sit down for a minute...(hesitates)

I think there might be something wrong with me... or maybe I'm just getting older. (laughs) You know how they say ""use it or lose it""? I've been trying to stay active, but my knees have been giving me trouble lately... anyway... this phlegm business... brownish color, you said?

I was lookin' for them just a minute ago... (laughs) Oh dear...

You see, doc, or whoever you are... I'm feelin' quite ill, if you don't mind my sayin'. All these symptoms, they're all mixed up in me head like a big ol' jumble. Can you help me untangle them? (pauses again) Did I have that cup of tea already?"
119,Pneumonia,"I'm having a lot of trouble breathing and am really uneasy. I'm feeling unwell and am perspiring a lot. My chest hurts and I have a lot of mucus in my throat. My heart is racing, and the hue of the mucus I'm coughing up is off.","I don't know if you can help me with this, Doc... or is it Dr. Johnson? Wait, I think it was Doctor... uh... Anyway, I've been feeling terrible lately. My breathing's all off and I'm getting a lot of... *coughs* Excuse me. Oh dear, I hope I didn't just get something on your white coat. Ah, yes! So, my chest hurts like the devil himself is sitting on it. And this mucus in my throat? It's just too much. My husband always says I cough up more phlegm than a wet cat. *chuckles* Sorry, where was I? Oh right, so my heart's racing like a jackrabbit, and the color of the stuff I'm bringing up... it's not normal, if you know what I mean. Not exactly yellow, but not white either... *pauses*","I don't know what's wrong with me, doc... I feel like I'm drowning, ya see? Trouble breathing, that is. Can't catch my breath, and it's makin' me mighty uneasy, too. (pauses) You know, I had a cousin who died of some kind of lung disease... or was it the heart? No, no, it was definitely lungs. Poor fellow. (trails off)

Anyway, like I said, I'm feelin' unwell. My body's been sweatin' buckets, and I don't just mean my face, if you know what I mean. (chuckles) You'd think it's summer outside or somethin', not winter with the heat on. Now, where was I? Ah yes... chest hurts. Not too badly, but enough to notice, like a dull ache. (pauses again)

Now, mucus in my throat... and lots of it! Makes me cough all day long. (coughs) Excuse me... you know what I just remembered? My grandma used to give me cod liver oil for my lungs. She said it'd help 'em stay healthy... or was that the doctor's advice? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up!

And then there's this... heart racin', like a wild animal. I swear, my heart's tryin' to escape! (giggles nervously) And the mucus I'm coughin' up... it's not just white, ya see? It's got some sort of yellowish tint to it now. Yellow! You know what yellow is? Lemons and bananas! (trails off)

I don't know how long this has been goin' on, but I think it's been a while. Weeks maybe? Months? (shakes head) No, no, it can't be that long... (laughs weakly)"
120,Pneumonia,I can't seem to get enough air and I'm sweating a lot. I don't feel well and there's a lot of phlegm in my throat. My chest hurts and my heart is racing. The mucus I'm coughing up is reddish in color.,"""Well, doctor... um... I don't know if this is all related, but I was watching the news yesterday and they were talking about some new thing... can't quite remember what it was... anyway. Oh dear, where did my mind go? Ah yes! So, I've been feeling just terrible lately. Can't catch my breath, you see. And sweat - Lord have mercy, I'm dripping like a faucet. My chest, it hurts... I think it's been hurting since that time we went to the beach last summer... or was it winter? Oh dear, those days all blend together these days.

""Now, where was I? Ah yes! The phlegm in my throat. It's all sticky and yellowish, but there's a lot of it. And when I cough, this reddish mucus comes up. My heart, it's racing like a rabbit... or is that the dog? Oh dear, my mind is as foggy as my glasses these days! Anyway, doctor, I just don't feel right at all...""","I don't know if I can get this all out... *pauses* Ah, yes... the air. It's just that I need a lot of it, but even then... *gulps* ...my chest feels tight. Like someone's got their arms wrapped around me. *coughs*

Oh dear, and the sweating! Lord have mercy, I'm dripping like a faucet. My shirt's all soggy now. *chuckles nervously* Not that it matters at this point... I mean, I've got more important things on my mind. *pauses again*

Phlegm, yes... it's everywhere. I can feel it in the back of my throat, like a big ol' glob. Reddish, if I remember right... no, wait, was that the other day? Or yesterday? Doesn't matter now, anyway. It's red and nasty. *coughs again*

My heart, though... *taps chest* It's going to burst out of me! Like a drummer in a band or something. Racing, it is. Always racing when I'm... *pauses once more* What was I saying? Ah yes, the symptoms. You see, Doc... or is it Nurse? No, no... you're the one with the white coat. *laughs*

I remember now: it started after that big dinner at my daughter's house. All them rich foods and... and... *struggles to recall* Oh dear, what was I talking about? *coughs* Excuse me..."
121,Pneumonia,"I'm sweating profusely and can't seem to get enough air. My throat is filled with a lot of mucus, and I don't feel good. My heart is pounding, and my chest aches. I'm coughing up reddish-colored mucous.","You know, doc... I've been feelin' just terrible for days now. Been sweatin' buckets, can't catch my breath. It's like tryin' to breathe through a wet sponge. My throat's all stuffed up with mucus, it's awful. Can't even swallow without coughin'. And then there's this... this pounding in my chest. Like someone's bangin' on the door. I'm gettin' these pains... achy pains... can't quite place 'em. Remind me of that time I slipped on a patch of ice and bruised my ribs. Wait, what was the year again? Oh dear, got it! '62. Anyway... this chest pain's been goin' on for... hmm... could be two days now? No, three? Ugh, my head's all foggy... And I've been coughin' up this reddish stuff. Not just once or twice, but all the time. Like I'm tryin' to get somethin' outta my system.","I'm sweatin' somethin' fierce, doc... can't seem to catch my breath, you know? It's like I'm stuck in a swamp or somethin'. Got all this mucus in my throat, and it hurts, Lord have mercy. Can't swallow nothin' without feelin' like I'm gonna choke.

My heart's racin' like a wild mustang, and my chest... well, it just feels like someone's been kickin' me with their boots on. Coughin' up this reddish stuff... what was that stuff again? Reddish-colored mucus? Ah yes, the doctor said I had that last time too...

Now, where was I goin'? Oh yeah, my symptoms! Can't stop sweatin', and I feel like I'm gonna pass out if I don't get some air. But every time I try to take a deep breath... (pauses) You know, I remember when I used to walk to school uphill both ways... no sidewalks, nothin'! We had real snow, not that slushy stuff they got now...

Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, the sweatin'. It's just... it's just like my Aunt Edna said, ""You're just gettin' old, boy!"" (chuckles) But I'm tellin' ya, doc, I don't feel right. Reddish mucus, sweatin', and this chest pain... it's all mixed up in here..."
122,Pneumonia,I can't seem to catch my breath and I'm sweating a lot. I feel really sick and have a lot of phlegm in my throat. My chest hurts and my heart is racing. The mucus I'm coughing up is yellowish.,"Doc... um... can't catch my breath, you see... (pauses) Oh dear, I was out in the garden yesterday and I couldn't even weed for five minutes without needing a break... (chuckles) My husband says I'm getting old, but I said ""I'm not that old!"" (laughs) Ah, anyway...

Feel really sick, doc. Got a lot of phlegm in my throat. Chest hurts, you know? Like someone's poking me with a needle. And my heart... it's racing like a horse, I swear! (taps chest) Can't catch my breath at all. Sweating a lot too... (pauses to adjust glasses) Oh, what was the question again?

Yellow mucus, doc. That's what I'm coughing up. Not clear like it used to be. Used to be when I was young and healthy... (smiling wistfully) Now, let me think... when did my sister get that new kitchen? Last year? Two years ago? Oh dear, can't remember...

Where was I? Ah yes, yellow mucus. That's what I'm coughing up. And it hurts to breathe. Like someone's sitting on my chest. (pauses, taking a deep breath)","I... uh... can't seem to catch my breath. And I'm sweatin' a lot. Like I'm runnin' from somethin', ya know? (pauses) Wait, what was that recipe I wanted to try out? Oh yeah, chicken and dumplings. My sister used to make it for me when I was sick. Anyway... like I said, I'm sweatin' a lot. And I feel really sick. Got a lot of phlegm in my throat. It's like there's somethin' stuck up there. (coughs) Ugh.

Oh boy, this is no good. My chest hurts somethin' fierce. And... and... (pauses, searching for words) you know what I mean? Like when you got that sharp pain in your chest? Yeah, it's like that. And my heart's racin'. Lord have mercy. I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

Now, where did I put those cough drops? I think I left 'em on the kitchen counter... or was it the coffee table? (chuckles) Oh well, I'll find 'em later. The important thing is this mucus in my throat. It's yellowish, like... like cheese or somethin'. Not that I'm sayin' it tastes like cheese, but... (trails off)

You know what? My friend Edna used to have trouble with her sinuses too. She went see some specialist... uh... (pauses) Oh yeah! An ear, nose, and throat doc. That's the one. Maybe I should go see him too. Yeah, that's what I'll do.

Now where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. So it's like this: chest pain, racing heart, yellow mucus... (sighs) I hope it ain't somethin' serious."
123,Pneumonia,"I'm dripping with perspiration and can't seem to catch my breath. My throat is filled with a lot of phlegm, and I feel awful. My heart is pounding, and my chest aches. I'm coughing up brownish mucous.","Doc, I'm feelin' just awful... (pauses) You know, my wife, Edna... no, not Edna, Mabel! She made me those lovely pancakes for breakfast yesterday, but I just couldn't finish 'em. Too much syrup, I think. (chuckles) Anyway...

I've been drippin' sweat all morning, and I'm gettin' winded just walkin' to the kitchen. Throat's full of phlegm, like someone poured molasses in there. And my heart, it's racin' like a jackrabbit! Chest hurts somethin' fierce... (pauses) Now, let me think when we last went to see that nice young doctor... was it last week? Or the week before? Time just slips away on me...

Coughed up some brown stuff this mornin', too. Not sure what that means, but I'm hopin' you can tell me, Doc. (sighs) Just feel like a mess, if you know what I mean...","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I'm dripping with perspiration, you see... can't seem to catch my breath at all... (sighs) My throat, oh my throat, it's filled up with a lot of phlegm... and I feel just awful, like I've got the flu or something. But no, no, doctor said it wasn't the flu... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, breathing... it's all... wheezy-like... can't get enough air in my lungs. My heart, oh dearie me, is pounding like a drum... right out of my chest! And this... this ache in my chest... feels just like that time I had that... you know, that thing with the lung collapse? No, no, not that one... but it's similar, don't you think?

Now, let me start again. (pauses) This coughing up brownish mucous business... I'm afraid I've been doing that a lot lately. Brownish, yes, brownish... like coffee or something. (chuckles) Coffee! Now I remember: I had some terrible coffee last week, maybe it's from that? No, no, I'm getting old, I forgot what I was saying...

Oh dear me, my mind is all... fuzzy today. Ah, but the perspiration... dripping like a faucet, I tell you! (laughs) And don't even get me started on the phlegm. It's like a war in there... my throat's under siege! (trails off again) What was I saying?"
124,Pneumonia,I'm having a hard time breathing and I feel really uncomfortable. I'm sweating a lot and there's a lot of phlegm in my throat. My chest hurts and my heart is beating fast. The mucus I'm coughing up is brownish.,"I'm havin' trouble breathin', doc... can't get no air in my lungs like that. I feel all uncomfortable and whatnot. Sweatin' a lot, yeah, it's hot in here too, ain't it? I swear, every time I go to the grocery store with Helen, I always forget where I put my coupons... anyway...

There's just a bunch of gunk stuck in my throat. My chest hurts somethin' awful, like someone's poundin' on it. And my heart, oh boy, it's racin' like a wild mustang! The mucus I cough up's all brownish, you know? Like coffee grounds or somethin'. Now, where did I put that recipe for Helen's famous chicken soup...","I don't know if it's just the weather or what, but I'm having a right ol' time breathing. It's like my chest is all tight and constricted. And this sweating! Good grief, I'm dripping like a faucet. My wife always says I'm too sensitive to heat... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Anyway, there's this... phlegm in my throat. Too much of it, if you ask me. Brownish, they are. Don't know what that means. Did the doctor say something about... uh, coughing up brown mucus? (trails off)

And then there's this heartbeat business. It's like my heart's racing a horse. Fast as can be! Can't even sit still without feeling it pounding away. My wife says I should take it easy, but what's the point of that? (chuckles) You know, my cousin Edna had something similar when she was young... or was it old? Wait, no, it was her sister, Ethel. She had a bad cough and couldn't breathe for weeks on end.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, chest hurts. Like someone's stuck a knife in there. Or maybe it's just the arthritis acting up again... ( mutters to self) I swear, these new pill bottles are impossible to read...

Oh dear me! Sorry, getting all sidetracked. So, this breathing business... and heart beating fast. Can't even watch TV without feeling like I'm going to pass out. My wife says I should rest more... but what's the point of resting when you're not even sure what's wrong with you? (laughs)"
125,Pneumonia,"I'm having trouble breathing and am quite uneasy. My throat is filled with a lot of phlegm, and I'm perspiring a lot. My heart is racing, and my chest aches.

(clears throat) My heart's racin', too. And it hurts to breathe in deep. Then there's this cough... (hesitates) I think it's been goin' on for a few days now.

Now, let me think on this for a sec... my heart, it's racin' like crazy... feel like it's gonna jump right outta my chest! (laughs awkwardly) And that ache in my chest? Ugh, it's just... (pauses, searches for words) you know what I'm sayin'? It's hard to breathe and all...

Coughing up this red stuff, too... never seen anything like it. My wife says it's not good... we had a doctor come by the house last week, didn't we? (distracted) Oh boy, I remember now! He said somethin' about my blood pressure bein' high... or was that just a routine check-up? (sighs) Anyway...

You know what's weird? I could've sworn I took those meds this mornin', but now I'm thinkin' maybe I forgot. Or did the cat take 'em? (laughs again, awkwardly) Oh dear me... anyway... it's just... (trails off)

I'll try to remember more when you ask... or wait, was I talkin'? Oh right! My symptoms! Yeah, that's what we were discussin', ain't it?"

I'm sweatin' buckets, it's like I just ran a marathon or somethin'...

Now my heart's racin', feel like a rabbit on Red Bull... (laughs) Red Bull... haven't seen those commercials in ages. My chest hurts somethin' fierce too... like someone took a sledgehammer to it... not that I've ever been hit with a sledgehammer, Lord forbid...

(pauses) My fatigue is just awful, and my heart is racing like crazy. Like a rabbit in a hat shop! (laughs briefly) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, the phlegm. Brownish stuff. Been coughing it up for days now.","I don't know if I'm doing this right, but... anyway, my fever's been real high, like one of those thermometers you break if it gets too hot... (pauses) You know what's funny? When I was a kid, we used to make our own thermometer out of a jar and some wax. Can't do that no more, I guess. (chuckles)

Anyway, breathing's been a problem. It's like my lungs are all clogged up with... with something. I don't know what. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing on Lake Michigan? Beautiful lake. Nice fishin' spots.

Oh, yes! My fever! It's got me drenched in sweat. Can't remember if it was today or yesterday that I took a shower... anyway, I'm shivering like crazy with chills. (mumbles to self) Must be getting old...

Fatigue? That's the word, right? Yeah, I'm plumb tuckered out. Like when you work in the garden all day and your back hurts something awful... but this is different, ain't it? My heart's racin' like a wild mustang! (laughs nervously) Must be that medicine I'm taking.

Expecting some brownish phlegm, too. (pauses, lost in thought) Did my wife ever tell you about our vacation to the Smoky Mountains? Beautiful mountains... wonderful cookin'...

(Recollects self) Oh, yes! My symptoms! Fever, trouble breathin', chills, fatigue... and this funny stuff comin' out of me lungs. Brownish color, if I recall correctly... (trails off into silence)"
132,Pneumonia,"I've been getting chills, feeling tired, and I can't seem to shake this cough. My chest aches and my heart feels like it's racing at a million miles per hour when I cough. I'm coughing out a foul rusty phlegm.","Well, you know, I've been feelin' just awful lately... (pauses) You remember that time we went to Florida for vacation? Lord have mercy, those alligators were big... (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, these chills. I get 'em in the evening, around... umm... six o'clock? No, it's always different times, but it feels like my bones are freezin' over. And this cough, dear me, it won't quit. (pauses) Now, what was your name again? Dr. Johnson? I'm so sorry, gettin' old... (clears throat) Where was I? Ah yes, the cough. It's always there, ragin' away like a wildfire. And when I cough, (takes a deep breath) my chest feels like it's goin' to split in two and my heart's racin' like a jackrabbit... (pauses again) Now, what was that medicine I took for my arthritis? The one with the fancy name... (sighs) Oh dear, I'll remember eventually...","I'm gettin' these chills, ya know? Like my whole body just shivers for no reason. Can't even explain it, doc... (pauses) Oh, I remember when I was a kid, we used to have them big ol' windows in the house, and they'd rattle with the wind. Reminds me of that... (trails off)

Anyway, I'm feelin' tired all the time. Can't even get outta bed in the mornin'. And this cough... it won't go away! It's like my lungs are all scratchy and whatnot. My chest aches somethin' fierce. And when I cough... (pauses, taking a breath) Lord have mercy, my heart goes into overdrive! Feels like it's racin' at a million miles an hour, ya know? Like it's gonna jump right outta my chest!

And what's this stuff comin' up? (coughs) Oh dear... this nasty, rusty phlegm. It's like nothin' I've ever seen before! (pauses, confused) Now, where was I? Ah yes, the chills. Like I said, they just come outta nowhere. Sometimes it's cold air, sometimes it's just bein' in a room with too many people... (trails off again)

You know what my grandma used to say about gettin' old? She'd say... (pauses, lost in thought) Oh dear me! I forgot what she said... but somethin' about how your body just starts fallin' apart when you're older. (chuckles) Like my knees, for instance... (laughs) Ah, but that's a whole 'nother story...

Anyway, like I was sayin', this cough and chills and all that business... it's been goin' on for weeks now. I'm gettin' so tired of feelin' miserable! Can't even enjoy my garden no more... (sighs)"
133,Pneumonia,I'm having a hard time breathing and I feel really uncomfortable. I'm sweating a lot and there's a lot of phlegm in my throat. My chest hurts and my heart is beating fast. The mucus I'm coughing up is brownish.,"Doc... (pause) excuse me, I think it was Dr. Smith who came in last week... anyway... (clears throat) I'm having a hard time breathing, ya know? It's like my chest is tight and it hurts when I take deep breaths. And my heart... (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh dear, I remember my sister Edna had something with her heart too... (trails off) Ah yes! My heart. It's beating fast, like a jackrabbit or somethin'. I'm sweatin' a lot and there's this yucky phlegm in my throat. Brownish color, it is. Like the soil in my garden last summer after the rain. Now where did I put that... (chuckles) Oh, right! My symptoms. And like I said, I feel really uncomfortable... (hesitates) When was it again, doc, when I saw you last?","I'm havin' a hard time breathin', you know? Like when I was a kid, we didn't have all these new-fangled machines helpin' people breathe... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, it's just that my lungs are feelin' like they're on fire. And the sweatin'! Lord have mercy, I'm sweatin' buckets. I swear, I must've gone through a whole roll of toilet paper this mornin'. (chuckles)

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the phlegm in my throat. It's like nothin' I've ever felt before. Like someone poured honey into my chest and it just won't come out! And then there's the coughin', all these brownish clumps comin' up... (pauses) You know, I used to help out at the hospital with my sister, she was a nurse... we'd have to wash down the floors after some of those poor souls came in with tuberculosis... (trails off)

Chest hurts somethin' fierce. And my heart's racin' like a horse! (laughs) Reminds me of that time I went on a hot air balloon ride... or was it a plane? Oh dear, anyway... the point is, I don't feel right. (pauses, takes deep breath) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?

Mucus, mucus... brownish mucus... it's just so... so... ugh! You know when you're cookin' and that one onion gets all soggy? That's what my chest feels like. (sighs) Help me out here, doc... I think I need some of that... uh... cough syrup stuff..."
134,Pneumonia,"I'm having trouble breathing and am really uncomfortable. I'm sweating profusely and have a lot of mucus in my throat. My chest aches, and my heart is racing. I'm coughing up dark mucous.","You know, doc... I've been feeling just awful for, uh, must have been two days now? Or was it three? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' a bit foggy lately. Anyway, I'm havin' trouble breathin', you see. Can't catch my breath no matter how hard I try. And I'm sweatin' somethin' fierce! Got me a towel wrapped around my neck just to keep the sweat from drippin' down into me coffee... or was it tea? Anyway, my throat's all clogged up with mucus. It's like someone poured glue in there. And I got this awful chest pain. Feels like someone's stuck a knife right between two of my ribs. My heart's racin', too. Goes boom-boom-boom! Like that old drummer at the VFW hall used to play... (chuckles) Oh, and I've been coughin' up dark stuff. Dark mucous, it is. Not like me usual runny nose kind...","I don't know if it's my back acting up again... (pauses) Anyway, I'm having trouble breathing, like when I was at the park last week and those newfangled exercise machines gave me trouble... (chuckles) No, no, that's not right... 

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes! Trouble breathing. It's like my chest is all scrunched up or something. And sweat, Lord have mercy, I'm sweatin' buckets! Must be the summer heat, but it's August and it's cool out... (pauses) Wait, I think I had this talk with the doctor last year about sweating... 

Mucus in my throat, that's right. Throat's all congested like when I used to get these awful colds back in the '50s. But no, it can't be a cold now, I've got a cold already, don't I? (laughs nervously) No, no...

Chest ache, heart racing... Oh dear, must be that high blood pressure of mine acting up again... or was it last week's doctor visit? (pauses) Wait, what were we talking about, anyway?

And this coughing up dark mucous business... (hesitates) I don't know if that's supposed to be normal. Dark, you say? Like coffee or something? No, no, that can't be right..."
135,Pneumonia,"I've got a high fever and can't seem to catch my breath. I've been sweating profusely and generally feeling ill and weak. I've also had some quite thick and black phlegm. My chest aches, and my heart has been racing rapidly.","You know, I've had this fever for... um... let me see... must have been three days now? Or is it four? Oh dear, my mind's going! Anyway, I'm feeling awful, Doctor. My temperature's always up, and I just can't get a good breath in. It's like someone's sitting on my chest, you know? And the sweating, goodness gracious... I've had to change these sheets three times today already! (chuckles) You know, reminds me of when I was younger, went to that resort in Florida, and the humidity just about killed me...

Now where was I? Ah yes, fever. It's been so bad, I couldn't sleep last night. Kept thinking it was my birthday party... or was it my grandchild's birthday? Anyway, I've had this awful cough too, with all sorts of gunk coming out. Thick and black, just like that chocolate syrup we used to make for the kids when they were little... (pauses) What was I saying? Oh yes, the phlegm! And my chest, it aches something fierce. Like someone's stabbed me with a knife. (gasps slightly)","I don't know if I'm getting a cold or something... (pauses) My sister had a cold last week, I think it was the flu? No, wait, she said it wasn't the flu... anyway... (clears throat)

Anyway, like I said, I've got this high fever and can't seem to catch my breath. It's like tryin' to breathe through a straw or somethin'. And I'm sweatin' buckets! My sheets were all wet this mornin', I had to change 'em. (chuckles) I used to change their sheets, not mine... (pauses)

You know what else? I've been coughin' up the most awful stuff. Thick and black, like tar or somethin'. It's just... ugh! My chest hurts too, it feels all tight and sore. And my heart, oh boy... it's racin' like a jackrabbit! (laughs nervously) I used to have one of them little dogs, what was its name? Oh dear...

Now where was I? Ah yes, my heart! It just won't slow down. I'm gettin' all lightheaded and stuff. And my fever... I think it's supposed to be 103 now? (pauses) My wife always kept a thermometer by the bed, you know? For when we had kids..."
136,Pneumonia,"Lately I've been experiencing chills, fatigue, a cough, a high fever, and difficulty breathing. I've been sweating a lot and just feeling really sick and weak. I've also had some phlegm that's been really thick and dark.","You know, I've been feeling pretty terrible lately... had the chills, ya know? And I'm always tired now. My wife says I sleep too much, but I don't see why that's a problem when you're sick. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to my grandson's baseball game? Oh, wait... where was I? Ah yes, the chills... and this cough just won't quit. It's like someone's scratching their nails on the blackboard in there. And the fever... it's been up and down, but mostly up, if you know what I mean.

I've also had some trouble breathing... (pauses) You know, my sister's birthday was last week, wasn't it? Or is that next month? Hmm... anyway... the breathing. It's like someone's got a tight band around my chest. And this phlegm... (shudders) it's so thick and dark, I don't even want to think about it.

(pauses again)

Oh, and one more thing: all this sweating! My sheets are always soaked, poor dear.","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, doc... I don't know if you've got time for me, but... (pauses) Oh dear, I just can't seem to get out of bed lately... Chills, you see... (stammers) chills and all that jazz. Fatigue, fatigue, everywhere... can't even walk to the kitchen without getting winded... (chuckles) My goodness gracious...

And then there's this cough... (coughs) Oh dear me, excuse me... I'm so sorry about that... (clears throat) Ah yes, the cough... it's been going on for days now. And my fever, high as a kite... (giggles) No, no, not really high like that, but you know what I mean... (trails off)

Sweating buckets, doc... buckets! I swear, I must have lost five pounds from all the sweating... and just feeling... (pauses, searching for words) weak. Weak in my bones, if you know what I mean... (nods to self) Like when I was a young'un...

Now let me think on this phlegm... it's been real thick and dark... like motor oil or something... (shudders) Ugh, just thinking about it makes me shiver. I've tried to bring it up, but it just won't come out... (pauses again) Oh, I had the most marvelous time at the gardening club last week... we planted a lovely new rose bush... (gets sidetracked) Rose bushes, you know...

Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms... difficulty breathing, that's what they are... can't catch my breath when I walk from the kitchen to the living room... (gulps air) Excuse me, doc..."
137,Pneumonia,"I've recently been suffering with chills, lethargy, a cough, a high temperature, and difficulties breathing. I've been sweating profusely and generally feeling ill and weak. I've also had some quite thick and black phlegm.",".. doctor's been on my case about gettin' that cough taken care of... anyway... yeah, I've had chills, you know? Felt like I was freezin' in my bed, even when it was hot outside. And lethargy, oh boy... just couldn't seem to muster up the energy for nothin'. Like the other day, I was tryin' to make myself a sandwich and I swear I must've fallen asleep standin' up.

Now, this cough... it's been goin' on for weeks now. High temperature, too. My thermometer said 102 degrees last night, but I'm not sure how that works... my sister used to say somethin' about how those things can be off by a few points, but what was her name again? Oh dear...

And sweatin', oh boy! It's like my body's tryin' to boil itself or somethin'. And the phlegm... it's just awful. Thick and black, like tar. I don't know how it's still hangin' around after all this time...","I'm so sorry doc... or is that the nurse? Oh dear, I got all mixed up... anyway... I've been feeling just terrible lately. Chills you know, like when you walk out of a movie theater and it hits you in the face. Brrr! Just like that every hour on the hour. My grandkids always tease me about being cold-blooded but this is different. Can't seem to shake it off.

And then there's this lethargy business... I swear, I used to be able to mow my own lawn, now I can barely walk up the steps without gettin' winded. What year was that again? We went on a trip to visit our son in Florida... (pauses) Ah yes! 2018! Must've been 2018. Anyway...

This cough of mine is killin' me. Sounds like a frog in my chest, I kid you not. And the fever, well... it's like someone poured gasoline on my tongue and lit it on fire. Ugh! Can't remember what that word is... Oh yes, temperature! It's been up to 102 degrees for days now. Sometimes when it drops at night I think I'm okay but come morning...

Now I know this might sound silly, but the sweating is driving me crazy. Sheets are always soggy by breakfast time and my poor husband can't take a shower with me anymore 'cause of all the water on the floor! Thick, black phlegm... just like coal dust from those old factories back in Pennsylvania. Ugh, what were we talkin' about again?"
138,Pneumonia,"Lately I've been experiencing chills, fatigue, a cough, a high fever, and difficulty breathing. I've been sweating a lot and just feeling really sick and weak. I've also had some phlegm that's been really thick and dark.","Doc... I've been feelin' just awful lately. Started with these chills, ya know? They'd come on outta nowhere. Like when I was a kid and we'd go to the lake house for summer vacation... my mom would always say it's 'cause of the cold water, but it wasn't that... Anyway, these chills were bad. Then came this fatigue. I couldn't even do my gardening no more. Just felt like I had lead weights in my legs.

Now, let me think when this cough started... was it after I saw the grandkids? Or was it before? Ah, shoot, can't remember now... Must've been a week or so ago, 'cause I had a fever. High one, too. Felt like someone poured a whole jug of hot water down my throat.

Got me sweatin' somethin' fierce at night, even with the AC on high. Don't know what's goin' on... Just feel so weak all over. And this cough, it's just awful. Like there's somethin' stuck in my chest. I've been bringin' up phlegm, but it's like tar or somethin'. Dark as coal. Lord have mercy...","I'm so sorry, doc... I don't know what's going on with me. Lately... (pauses) Excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, lately... I've been feeling just dreadful. Chills, you see... and fatigue, oh my goodness. I mean, I used to be able to walk a few blocks without getting winded, but now...(chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting off track.

A cough, that's been there for days... or is it weeks? (pauses again) Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, the cough. And this fever, doc... high as can be. My head hurts something awful. (rubs forehead)

Now, let me think... difficulty breathing, you know? Like my chest is all clogged up. And sweating... (dabs at brow with a handkerchief) Goodness gracious, I'm dripping like a faucet.

Oh dearie me... phlegm. Thick and dark as coffee grounds. It's just... ugh. Can't seem to get it out of my system. (gulps)

Now, what was the other thing? Oh yes... feeling weak. Just exhausted all the time. Can barely lift a cup of tea without getting tired. (pauses once more) And that cough... I'm so sorry about this doc. It's just... really quite dreadful.

You know, I had a cousin, Edna... or was it Mabel? Ah yes, Edna. She used to have the most terrible colds when she was my age. Poor thing...(trails off)"
139,Pneumonia,"I've recently been suffering with chills, lethargy, a cough, a high temperature, and difficulties breathing. I've been sweating profusely and generally feeling ill and weak.

(chuckles) anyway... and then there's this lethargy, always tired, can't seem to get outta bed in the mornin'. My wife says I'm snorin' somethin' fierce now. Cough's been botherin' me too, high-pitched sound like my niece when she had that cold last year... what was her name again? (pauses) Ah yes, Sophie! Anyway, got a fever, sweat's drippin' off me like I'm in a sauna or somethin'. Phlegm's real thick and red, like when I cut myself on the kitchen counter... (trails off)

 Wait, what day is it? Tuesday? Wednesday? Never can keep track of those young whippersnappers always tellin' me to write it down. Oh right, my symptoms! Yeah, breathin's gettin' tougher, feel like I'm strugglin' to catch a breath... (exhales slowly)","I don't know if I'm gettin' a cold or the flu, dear... my grandson says it's probably just the flu, but I've got all these symptoms... chills, lethargy, cough... (pauses) Oh, where did I put that cup of tea? Ah yes, the symptoms... high temperature, sweatin' like a pig, feelin' weak as a kitten... can't even get outta bed most days. (trails off)

You know, my aunt Edna used to get these awful colds every winter... (pauses) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the cough... it's so tickly and it makes me wanna gag sometimes... got all this thick, red phlegm stuck in my throat... (coughs) Excuse me... ugh.

It's like my body's just give up on me... can't even breathe proper no more... feelin' like I'm smothered or somethin'. (pauses again) Now, where did I put that box of tissues? I swear, I had 'em right here... (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, the chills... they come on outta nowhere, just like that. And the lethargy... it's like my whole body's just weighed down with lead... can't even get up to use the bathroom without feelin' like I'm gonna collapse... (trails off) Oh dearie me...

Wait a minute, was it last week or the week before...? No, no, it doesn't matter... what matters is that I need some help here... this feels awful."

(chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's goin'... and difficulties breathin', sweatin' like a pig, profusely, you know. And this phlegm, oh boy... thick and black as coal.

Anyway, like I was sayin', I've been feelin' quite poorly lately. Chills, you see, and lethargy, yes, that's a big one. Can't seem to get no energy to do nothin'. (chuckles) Reminds me of when my husband used to take me on walks in the park... what was it we were talkin' about again? Oh right! My symptoms!

Cough's been botherin' me somethin' fierce, and I got a fever, high one, I'm thinkin'. 102 maybe? (pauses) Or is that too low? Anyway, I've been sweatin' like a pig in the summertime. Can't keep no water down, feel like I'm gonna... you know, pass out on me. And them phlegm bubbles! Thick as molasses and black as coal. Don't know what's causin' it all. (pauses again) Wait, now where did I put my tea? I could swear I had a cup just here... (trails off)

(Returns to the conversation)
Oh dear me, sorry 'bout that. Like I said, feelin' quite poorly. Weak as a kitten and can't do nothin' about it. Just layin' around most days, tryin' to get some rest. But like my grandma used to say... (pauses once more) Oh, bother! What was the point of this conversation again?"
141,Pneumonia,"I've been having a lot of respiratory issues lately along with chills, exhaustion, a cough, and a high temperature. I've been sweating profusely and generally feeling ill and weak.

Can you believe I saw Edna Jenkins at church yesterday and she said her sister's cat got loose? (chuckles) Ah, never mind that.

Anyway, like I was sayin', my chest hurts somethin' fierce, like a sharp knife stabbin' through it. And don't even get me started on the temperature. It's always up, up, up! I feel like I'm runnin' a fever or somethin'. My heart's racin' faster than a freight train too... (pauses) What was I sayin'? Oh yes, my symptoms!

Brrr... can't seem to shake 'em off no matter how many blankets I use. And exhaustion... (pauses) Oh, I remember when my husband was alive, he'd always say ""take it easy, dear."" But I just kept going, of course. We had to get the garden done, and... (trails off)

Anyway... this cough. It's been bothering me somethin' fierce. And a high temperature? Well, I'm no doctor, but it feels like my body's on fire! Sweat, oh boy, I'm drippin' like a faucet with this sweat. Can't even go to the kitchen without needin' a towel... (chuckles) Ah, those were the days when I used to iron clothes for hours on end.

Now, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, my chest aches somethin' awful. And my heart... well, it's racin', just like that rabbit I had as a child, Mr. Fluffers. (pauses, lost in thought) We had the best times together, you know... He'd hop around in circles while I'd chase after 'em with a big ol' basket... (chuckles) Oh dear, sorry about that.

This heart of mine's been racin', too... Can't catch my breath sometimes. Feels like I'm runnin' up stairs forever. And then there are these... these chills. I just want to warm up, you know? Even when it's 80 degrees outside, I still shiver like a leaf.

Now, where did I put that aspirin? I swear, I had some in my bag... (gets distracted) You know, I used to love takin' walks around the block with friends. We'd talk about our gardens and share recipes..."

My body's just one big bag of bones and pain. I've been sweat-in' like a faucet, too... You know, just like when I was young and worked in the factory on hot days? We'd drink gallons of water and still be sweatin' buckets.

Now, about this cough... It's been gettin' worse by the day. I sound like a smoker from the city, not some harmless old lady. My chest feels like it's been put through a wringer, doc. Every time I breathe in, it's like someone's poundin' on my ribs with a hammer.

And this black phlegm... Oh dearie me, it's just awful. Reminds me of when my sister had that flu so bad she had to stay in bed for weeks. I think it was the '29 flu? Or was it '38? Anyway, it looks like tar or somethin' and it makes me cough even harder.

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my heart... It's been racin' like a wild mustang. I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna just collapse on the spot. My grandkids always tell me to take care of myself, but when you get older, it's hard to remember what that means anymore.

You know, I almost forgot about my breakfast... Or was it lunch? Anyway, I had a nice bowl of oatmeal with fresh strawberries and cream. That's the life..."

Okay, so I'm feelin' hot, and I'm sweatin' more than that young whippersnapper at the market who sells them tomatoes... you know, the ones with the stickers on 'em... (trails off) My wife's cousin's brother-in-law used to grow those tomatoes in his garden...

Anyway... my heart's racin', and it hurts here... (taps chest). Like when I was in the war... no, wait, that's a different story. Or is it? (chuckles)

I've had this phlegm, all black and sticky like tar on the highway... (shudders) Gives me the shivers just thinkin' about it. And my chest... (tries to remember what he was saying). Oh yes! My chest hurts somethin' fierce! Like when I fell off that ladder last year... no, that wasn't it either...

( rambling continues ) Where's my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table... Must be that new nurse who took it... You know, they say you get forgetful with age... (laughs) Well, I'll show 'em... I remember every detail! (pauses, collects thoughts) Ah yes, my symptoms. So, like I said, I'm runnin' a fever, got this phlegm... and my heart's goin' a mile a minute. That's about it, doc."
144,Pneumonia,"I'm drenched with sweat and can't seem to catch my breath. My throat is clogged with mucus, and I'm miserable. My heart is racing, and my chest aches. I'm coughing up a brownish stringy mucus.","Oh dear, I'm just so... sweaty. Can't catch my breath at all. Throat's clogged up something awful with mucus. Miserable is right, doctor. I mean, not that I see you very often, but... (chuckles) Anyway, this chest of mine, it aches somethin' fierce. Heart's racin' like a jackrabbit on Red Bull, if I'm bein' honest. And the coughing! Brownish stringy mucus, just awful. Reminds me of that time I was on vacation in Arizona and... (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, my symptoms. (clears throat) Sorry, where was I? Oh right, chest pain. Been havin' it for a few days now, or is it weeks? Time just slips away on you when you get older...","I don't know what's gotten into me, doctor... I'm drenched with sweat, can't seem to catch my breath... I remember one time, I was on a boat ride and got seasick, felt just like this. Or was it a picnic? Wait, no... (pauses) My throat, oh dear, it's all clogged up with mucus, feels like someone poured honey in there. Miserable is right... what was the word I was thinkin' of, uh... Ah yes, miserable.

My heart, it's racin', racin' like a rabbit, and my chest, it aches somethin' fierce. Coughs up all this brownish stringy mucus... like a spider web, you know? My grandma used to make those for me when I was young... she had the most beautiful lace curtains... (trails off) Mucus, yeah... and I'm coughin', can't stop coughin'... need some... uh... what's that stuff they give you for your throat? You know, when you got a tickle? (pauses again)

Now where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. It's like my body's just given up on me, and I'm stuck here with this... this... (snaps fingers) What do you call it? Oh dear, I'll get it eventually... You know what they say, 'if at first you don't succeed...' No, no, that's not it. Anyway... sweat, mucus, heart racin', chest aches... and my poor throat, just miserable, miserable... (sighs)"
145,Pneumonia,"I'm saturated with sweat and struggling to breathe. My throat is blocked with mucous, and I'm uncomfortable. My heart is racing, and my chest aches. I'm coughing up a darkish stringy mucous.","I'm just so... hot and bothered, dearie. Sweaty, like I've been runnin' a marathon in this heat. Can't catch my breath, it's all... (pauses) You know, I was talkin' to Edna yesterday, or was it the day before? Ah, anyway... My throat's all plugged up with goo, like someone poured glue in there. And I'm gettin' these sharp pains in my chest, right here (taps on chest). My heart's racin', Lord have mercy! Like a jackrabbit on Red Bull. And when I cough, it's this... this darkish stringy stuff comin' out. Like someone poured motor oil in me lungs or somethin'.","(Background noise of television and distant chatter) Oh dearie me... I'm so sorry, Doc... (pauses) My throat's all congested... can't catch my breath... feels like a big ol' knot in here... got me sweating buckets... can't stop... (chuckles nervously) reminds me of that one summer at the lake... you know, when I was younger?... I used to swim so much... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, my throat. It's just full of all this... (coughs) mucus, I think it is. Darkish stringy stuff... tastes awful... makes me cough and wheeze like an old engine... (laughs again) Oh boy, that's a good one! My engine... (chuckles to herself)

Oh dear... my heart's racing too... feels like it's gonna burst out of my chest... or something. And this ache in my chest... just below here... I don't know if it's my heart or what... but it hurts when I breathe in... and out... (pauses, looks around the room) You know, I think I left my glasses at home? Or was it in the kitchen?... oh dear...

Anyway, Doc, I'm feeling quite poorly. Like I need some rest... and maybe one of those inhalers or something... what's that stuff called?... (pauses again) Oh yes! The one with the puffs... you know what I mean?... Can't seem to catch my breath, no matter how hard I try... feels like a big ol' weight on my chest..."
146,Pneumonia,"I'm having a lot of problems breathing. I'm not feeling good, and I'm sweating a lot. I have a lot of mucous in my throat and my chest hurts. My breathing is laboured, and the phlegm I'm coughing up has an odd tint.","""Oh boy, doc... I'm having a lot of problems breathing. You know, like when I was younger and I used to mow the lawn? My nephew would always complain about the dust getting in his throat... (chuckles) anyway... I'm not feeling good, and I'm sweating a lot. Must be all these allergies coming on again... or maybe it's that cold I got last week? No, wait, was it the flu? Oh dear, can't keep track of those things no more... My granddaughter said something about me needing to get my blood pressure checked... (pauses) Ugh, anyway... I have a lot of mucous in my throat and my chest hurts. It's like someone's squeezing on my lungs or somethin'. My breathing is laboured, and the phlegm I'm coughing up has an odd tint, like coffee grounds or somethin'... (pauses again) What was that thing I went to last year? The one with all those nice pictures of flowers? Oh yes! The garden club meeting! Now where was I?""","I'm not feeling right, Doc... breathing's been a problem for me lately... (pauses) You know, I was just watching this old movie with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers the other day... Anyway, I'm sweating like crazy and my throat's all stuffed up... got this thick mucus everywhere. Can't seem to get rid of it. My chest hurts too, right here (taps chest). Feels like a big ol' bruise.

And breathing, well... it's not easy anymore. It's labored, you know? Like I'm always running uphill or something. I swear, my grandma used to have this one remedy for when she had the flu... now what was it again? Oh yeah, that tea with mint and lemon! My goodness, I wish I could remember how to make it.

Phlegm's a problem too... (coughs) excuse me. It's all yellowish-green, like someone poured paint in my lungs or something. Don't rightly know what that means, but it sounds bad. I'm getting all the time now... and these dreams! Terrible dreams about running out of breath and stumbling around... Oh dear Lord, I hope I don't get one of those tonight.

Anyway, Doc... (pauses again) what was I saying? Ah yes! My breathing. Well, it's a real concern for me now. Like I'm drowning in my own bed or something. Don't know what to do about it."
147,Pneumonia,"I have a lot of difficulty breathing. I don't feel well, and I'm perspiring a lot. My chest hurts, and I have a lot of mucus in my throat. I'm having trouble breathing, and the phlegm I'm coughing up has a strange hue.","...I don't feel right, doc. Can't breathe worth beans. Been havin' this trouble for a few days now... no, wait, is it more like two? I get confused about the days somethin' fierce. Anyway, my chest hurts somethin' awful and I'm sweatin' buckets. My throat's all clogged up with phlegm, lots of mucus... y'know what that reminds me? The time I had pneumonia back in '67. That was a nasty one... anyway, this phlegm I've been coughin', it's got a funny color to it. Not yellow like it usually is, more brownish-red... or is that just the coffee from breakfast still in my system?","I don't know if I can... uh... breathe right now, doc. Or, you know, not breathe? (chuckles) Oh dear, what was that noise outside? Never mind. Anyway, I feel like I've been hit by a truck or somethin'. My chest hurts somethin' fierce. And sweating! Good grief, I'm sweatin' like it's July in the desert again. Mucus everywhere. In my throat, on my pillow... (pauses) You know what? I used to love those little pillows that come with your morning coffee? (trails off)

Focus, Edna! Focus! Where was I? Ah yes, chest hurts and mucus. And breathing... trouble breathing, that's the thing. Can't catch my breath like... like when I'm at the store, and I have to hurry home before they close for the day. (chuckles) Oh boy, those were the days...

Now, where's my tea? I had it right here. (pauses to look around) Hmmph. What was I sayin'? Ah yes, phlegm. It's got this funny color, like... like rust or somethin'. Been coughin' up stuff for weeks now. Not just any old mucus, mind you! This is the weird kind. Now, did I tell you about the time I met my husband at the diner? (starts rambling) He had a great sense of humor, that one..."
148,Pneumonia,"I've been coughing a lot and feeling incredibly chilly and exhausted. I have a pretty high fever, and it's difficult for me to breathe.

I mean, I'm not sure if it's a cold, but... anyway. Been feelin' so chilly, even when I'm all bundled up. And that fever... Lord have mercy, it's through the roof! My wife says I've been sweatin' like a pig, but I don't know about that... (chuckles) Oh, Edna, my sister-in-law, she had a bad cold last year too... didn't she? Or was it her cousin? Um, anyway. It's hard to breathe, and I'm gettin' so tired all the time. My legs feel like lead... (pauses) Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my phlegm! Thick as mud, black as coal. I've been coughin' it up for days now.","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... or maybe it was my sister Edna who had somethin' like this last year? Or was it my cousin Harold? Anyway, I've been coughin' a lot and feelin' just awful, ya know? Freezin', I mean. I got the chills somethin' fierce. And my joints ache, too... (pauses) Oh, wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, I'm so tired all the time. Can't seem to get outta bed without feelin' like I've been run over by a truck.

And this fever of mine! Lord have mercy, it's hot, like someone's poured gasoline on my insides. (chuckles) Don't know what that means, but it sounds right, don't you think? (pauses again) Now, where was I? Ah yes... difficulty breathin'. That's the big one, doc. Or is it the little one? (laughs softly)

And the sweat! Good gravy, I'm sweatin' like a pig in a pen. Can't seem to stop myself from drippin' all over the place. Weak as a kitten, that's what I am. (starts to ramble) You know, my grandma used to make these... um... apple cider donuts? No, wait, those were at the fair. She made them homemade biscuits with jam and cream. Always gave 'em to me when I was feelin' under the weather.

Now, where's that phlegm? (pauses, confused) Thick as tar, I'm tellin' ya! Black as coal. Can't... can't... uh... what's that word I'm thinkin' of? (snaps fingers) Ah yes! Mucus! That's it. Got a whole bucket of the stuff. Ugh!"
149,Pneumonia,"I've recently had chills, exhaustion, a cough, a high temperature, and breathing issues. I've been perspiring a lot and generally feeling weak and ill. I've had some quite thick and black phlegm. My heart has been racing quite quickly.","You know, doc... I've had these chills and exhaustion, can't seem to shake 'em off.

Anyway, got this cough now, it's been bothering me for a few days, maybe more... high temperature too, I'd say around 102 degrees? Or was it 101? No matter, it's high. And breathing issues, yeah, that's the worst part. My chest feels like it's gonna burst sometimes. (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's all over the place today...

And this phlegm! Thick as mud, black as coal, just awful. (pauses to collect thoughts) I think I mentioned this already... Ah yes, heart racing too. Quickened up like a rabbit. That's what the young ones say, isn't it? Rabbits and quick feet... (trails off)

(Sighs) Sorry about all this. Just feeling mighty under the weather. Can you give me some of that strong medicine, doc? The one with the... uh, name on the bottle... (pauses again)","I don't know if I'm remembering this right... but I think it started with these chills, yeah? And then the exhaustion came along, and I'm pretty sure that was after I ate that big ol' plate of spaghetti on Tuesday... or was it Wednesday? (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway. 

Ever since then, I've had this cough. It's been a real doozy. High fever too. Must be my blood pressure again. Always gettin' worked up about my blood pressure. My neighbor says he's got a friend who... anyway.

The sweating, it's been like a faucet's gone loose or somethin'. Can't stop drippin', you know? And the weakness... I was gonna mow the lawn yesterday but didn't have the energy to even get out of bed! Had to call my grandson to do it for me. (pauses) 

The phlegm, though... that's been a real concern. Thick as molasses, blacker than coal. Reminds me of when I was a kid and had bronchitis after goin' fishin' with my brother. Now let me think on this... what was the point I was makin'? Ah yes!

My heart's racin' like a jackrabbit in a cage! Can't sit still, always gettin' up to grab another cup of tea or somethin'. And the breathing? Felt like I've got an elephant sittin' on my chest most nights. Just can't catch my breath, ya know?

Yeah, constipation's been a problem for me lately. And when I do go, it hurts something fierce. My bottom's all inflamed and red, like a tomato. And the stool, well, it's been coming out looking like raw meat, if you can imagine. Bloody, I mean... all bloody. Just terrible.

You know, my sister-in-law was saying how she knows someone who had this one time... but anyway, I'm not sure what's causing it. Must be something I ate, though. Maybe that beans and sausage thing we had at the church potluck? No, wait, was that last week or the week before?

Oh dear, I just can't seem to remember. And my granddaughter's birthday party is coming up... but I digress. The pain's been getting worse, doc. It's like a burning sensation down there.","Doctor, you know I've been having some trouble with... um... (pauses) bowel movements, yes, that's right. It's just been a bit of an issue lately. Constipation, you see. Can't go like I used to. (chuckles) Used to be able to eat anything and it'd all come out the other end no problem. Now it's just... stuck.

And then there's this... discomfort. Pain when I have my, ahem, business. (pauses again) You know what I mean? In that area. Anus pain, they call it. Sounds like something out of a medical textbook, doesn't it? (laughs)

Now, let me tell you, my anus has been quite... inflamed. Red, sore, all that jazz. And the stool... well, the stool's been a bit of a problem too. Extremely bloody, as I said. Not just a little bit, mind you. No, no. It's like it's bleeding from everywhere! (pauses once more) You know, I was talking to my sister the other day and she told me her cousin had that same issue... what's his name? Oh dear, can't remember. Anyway, they said he just had a bit of an... imbalance in his system or something.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the bloody stool! It's been happening for weeks now. Weeks! And I've tried everything: fiber, prune juice, even that one pill... what's it called? (taps forehead) Can't remember the name, but you know, it helps with, uh, digestion. Yes, that's right.

Anyway... (pauses again) Oh, and I was reading about something in the newspaper the other day. Something about people who have, ahem, loose stools all the time. Not me, of course! No, no. My problem is the opposite, you see. But still... it got me thinking. Maybe there's some new treatment or something?"

But anyway... (pauses) 

Lately, I've been experiencing constipation, yes, that's the word. It's like, it takes me forever to go to the bathroom now. And when I do, oh dear... it hurts so bad. Pain during bowel movements, is what you'd call it, right? (laughs slightly) 

And then there's this... bleeding. My stool has been really bloody, and my anus... well, it just feels like it's on fire, if you know what I mean. Irritated, yes, that's the word. It's all red and sore-looking, even when I'm not going to the bathroom.

 Wait, did I tell you about Edna? She was at the doctor for weeks before they figured out what was wrong... (trails off)","I'm so glad I came in today... *pauses* Oh dear, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, now let me think... (sigh) Anyway... Lately I've been having these troubles with, uh, going to the bathroom. Constipation's a big word, isn't it? Yeah, that's what the nurse at the retirement home said. *trails off* Oh, speaking of which, I had the most wonderful time playing bingo there last week...

Now, where was I? Ah yes... (pauses again) It hurts when I go to the bathroom. And not just a little bit, if you know what I mean. It's like someone's poking me with a stick all the time. *mutters* Must have eaten something funny... Or maybe it's that new medicine they gave me for my high blood pressure...

And don't even get me started on the, uh... (tries to find the right word) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinking of? Ah yes! My stool! It's like, it's all bloody and whatnot. Like when I used to work in the garden and would get dirt under my fingernails. *chuckles* Good times...

But seriously now... (pauses once more) This anus of mine, it's been irritated something fierce. Like a mosquito bite that just won't go away. Or maybe like when I got those warts on my hands last year... I think it was the doctor said they were caused by that new soap I started using? *gets sidetracked* Did you know that soap can cause warts?...

Oh dear, where's my train of thought gone now? Ah yes! The bathroom troubles. (pauses again) I hope you can do something about this, Doctor..."

My stomach's been a bit off lately. Can't seem to find the words... you know how it is when you get older and your brain gets all muddled? (chuckles) I swear, I used to remember my wife's recipe for chicken soup from scratch, but now... (shrugs) Oh well! 

Now where was I? Ah yes, my troubles. So, using the bathroom has become quite a chore. I mean, I'm not exactly an expert on these things, but it seems like every time I try to go, it's just... agony. The pain is right there, in the back of my bottom, and it feels like it's burning or something. (pauses) 

And don't even get me started on the stool. It's all... bloody. I've been worried sick about that. My sister-in-law had some kind of... rectal issues when she was younger, but I think she said it was something different. Oh dear, what was her problem again? (laughs) 

Anyway, like I said, I'm having trouble with bowel movements and my bottom's all inflamed. I just wish someone could give me a good recipe for some soothing tea or something..."

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the blood. It's not too bad, but it's there. And sometimes, after I go... *taps on knee*... I feel this burning sensation. Like my skin is on fire! You know what that feels like? *laughs nervously*

Oh dear me, I'm getting all mixed up. *pauses to collect thoughts* So, the pain and irritation around my... you know... bottom? It's just not right. Can't seem to get comfortable no matter what I do. *mutters to self* Must remember to pick up more of those nice sit-down things for the toilet...

Oh dear, what was that other thing? Ah yes, around my anus... I've had this itching and discomfort, you know? Like someone's scratching me or something.

I'm pretty sure it started a few weeks ago, but now I'm thinking maybe it was longer than that... Hmm, anyway.

Oh dear me! The pain! It's like... (struggles to find words) a burning sensation. Down below. You know. (awkward pause) I've been trying to, ah, go as needed... but it hurts so much! And then there's the blood in my stool. I'm not sure what that means, exactly... (looks around the room)

And around here... (taps buttocks) ...I get this itchiness. Frustrating! Makes me scratch like a chicken! (laughs) My sister used to have that problem, too... or was it my cousin? Hmm... (trails off)

My bottom's all red and sore afterwards too.

Now, let me think for a second, when did this start? Was it last week or the week before? Ah yes, I remember now! It started after that big dinner at my niece's house. You know, the one with the roast beef? Mmm... good cookin'! But anyway, since then...

And another thing, there's been some blood in my stool. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. And it's always when I'm trying to go. My anus is all irritated and sore, too.

Now, about this blood in my stool... (pauses again) Hmm, I think that's what's been troublin' me lately. I remember my Aunt Edna had the same thing... or was it my cousin?

Severe constipation, it's a real nuisance, if you ask me. Can't go to the bathroom like I used to. And when I do, oh dear (winces) it hurts so much! Like someone's scratchin' a chalkboard in there. (giggles nervously)

I did have some blood in my stool too... I think it was last week? No, wait, was that the week before? (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all foggy like the attic on a winter morning...

Anyway, I've been havin' these episodes for quite a while now. Can't remember exactly when they started... was it after I stopped eatin' those beans or somethin'? Ah well, never mind...","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, but... um... I think I might have some problems down below, ya know? (pauses) I've been using my Metamucil like clockwork, but still, nothing's moving. It's been, oh, three days now, maybe four? And when I do go... (hesitates) it hurts a lot, doc. I mean, it used to be just fine, and then suddenly... (trails off)

You know what else has been bothering me? This itch! Oh my stars, I scratch and scratch but it don't help none. It's like there's an ant hill down there or something. (laughs nervously) And the blood in my stool... well, that's just not right at all. My wife said I should see you about this ages ago, but I'm stubborn, ya know? Don't want to be one of those people with colon problems... (chuckles) You remember Mr. Jenkins from down the street, don't you?

Now where was I? Ah yes! The pain and stuff in my stool. It's not just constipation, doc. Sometimes it feels like there's a small rock stuck up inside me, trying to come out. I try to push... (pauses) but that only makes it worse. And then I'm thinking about this new TV show I started watching with the Mrs., ""That's So"" something or other... you know what I mean? (laughs again)

Anyway, doc, could we take a look at my behind, please? I've heard some of these problems can be fixed with some cream or... (trails off) Wait, was it colon cream or hemorrhoid cream? (chuckles uncertainly)"

Ah yes, anyway...

Bloody, just like when we had that big storm last year and all the streets flooded. (trails off)

And then there's this... irritation down below. Can't exactly explain it. Feels like someone's put sandpaper to my skin. (looks around the room) I think I might've told you about this before, but...

Every time I try to go. And then... and then there's the blood. In my stool. (hesitates) You'd think it would be easier, ya know? But nope.

Now, let me see if I can remember... (pauses, looks around the room) My Aunt Edna used to have trouble with her bowels, too... I think she had some kind of... (snaps fingers) what was it? Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue. (chuckles)

Oh, and my anus! It's just all red and sore. Like it's been burned or somethin'. And I've been usin' that new toilet paper with the extra softness... but still... (sighs) You'd think a simple thing like goin' to the bathroom wouldn't be so much trouble, but...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! The pain. It's like... (tries to describe it again) well, you know how sometimes your body just decides to do somethin' else entirely? Like when you're tryin' to sleep and suddenly... (stops abruptly)

Now, let me think on this for a sec... It started about two weeks ago? No, three? Maybe four... (trails off) Oh, I know! My grandson came visit and we watched that ball game together. We had some hot dogs... (distracted) You like baseball, don't you?

Now, where was I? Ah yes, bathroom troubles. Like I said, it's been a real pain. Can't go as easy as I used to, if you know what I mean... And let me tell you, my backside's been feelin' like...

They had the most wonderful senior discount... *clears throat* Ah yes, so the pain down there has been quite... substantial. And it's not just when I go, it's all day, every day. My stool, well... let me put it this way: it's not coming out as smoothly as it used to. There's blood, dear doctor.

Anyway, back to the bathroom troubles. So, it hurts when I go, and then there's this pain in my anus. (pauses again) Now, what was that thing I needed at the grocery store yesterday? Ah yes, milk! Can't forget the milk for my cereal. (sighs) Focus, focus...

This... uh... stool business of mine has been quite the problem. Bloody it is. Don't know if I should be eating more fiber or something. And this irritation in my anus... I swear, it's like sandpaper down there! I've tried using that cream my sister recommended, but no luck so far. (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I saw that movie with Gregory Peck?

My stool has been bloody, too. I don't like saying that out loud, but... (hesitates) Oh dear, did I ever tell you about the time I went on a trip to Europe and had to eat all those strange foods? I think that's what set this off. Or maybe it was when I got that stomach bug from eating too many beans...

Where was I? Ah yes, the bathroom. It's just so... (pauses again) You know how it is when you gotta go, but then it hurts? (speaks slowly and carefully) And there's blood in my stool, doc. Can't remember exactly what they call that, but it doesn't sound right, does it? (chuckles nervously)

My anus... oh dear, I think that's the word... has been giving me a bit of trouble too. Itches something fierce! I swear, I've scratched it till it bled already this week. *laughs* And then there's this burning sensation, like my behind is just on fire. No, no, not like that. More like... (pauses to think) Hmm, can't quite put my finger on it...

Now, what was the question again? Oh yes, my butt. Well, let me tell you, doc, it's been acting up something fierce! *ahem* I've also had some discomfort in my... uh, what did they call it? Proctitis? Is that right? No, no... (shakes head) Never mind. It just hurts, okay?

Oh, look! The clock on the wall says it's time for my medication! I'll be right back, doc. *gets up and rummages through purse* Now, where did I put that other pill..."

Anyway, when I do finally go, it hurts. Yes, hurts. And then there's the blood. Now, I'm not one to worry about a little bit of blood here and there, but this is different. It's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin'. You know? (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I went on that cruise? Beautiful ship, just beautiful... We saw dolphins playin' in the water...

Oh, right! The bathroom troubles. So, it hurts and there's blood, like I said. And then there's this pain in my... backside, I suppose you'd call it. Just a dull ache, but it's always there. And the itchiness? Lord have mercy, it's like a million ants crawlin' on me at once! (chuckles) My neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, she said her husband had that same problem... or was it her mother? Ah, I'm gettin' all confused now.

Now, where was I? Oh yes, the pain and itchiness. It's like my bottom's just... rebelled against me, is what it feels like. And I don't know what to do about it! That's why I came in today, dear doc... or whatever your name is..."

Constipated, you see? Been that way for weeks, months maybe? Don't know exactly. Can't even remember when I last went. (pauses again) Oh dear, I just remembered! My cousin's funeral was yesterday, and we had a lovely lunch... anyway. Since I've been constipated, usin' the restroom has been quite challengin', if you know what I mean.

It aches, you see? Down there. And when I do go, it burns. Shoots like lightnin'. ( winces) Lord have mercy. Then there's this blood in my stool... don't know where that comes from. And the itchiness! Goodness gracious, I scratch and scratch, but it just won't go away.

Discomfort in my butt, is what my granddaughter called it. (laughs softly) Sweetie, always tryin' to help. But seriously, Doctor, I've been feelin'... (hesitates) It's not like a regular pain, you see? More like a naggin', a pressure. Like there's somethin' stuck in there. (trails off)

Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now. What were we talkin' about again? Ah yes! My backside. It's just been so... irritated lately.

I think it started a few weeks ago... or was it last month? No, no, I'm sure it was longer than that. Time just slips right away from me these days...

It's like my food just goes straight through me without stopping anywhere in between. And when it does decide to stop, well, let's just say it hurts. Down there. In the... um... bottom. Yeah. Like a burning sensation or something.

Now, I've been having some trouble sitting down because of this pain, and my stool's been all... bloody. Red stuff. Not like after I ate that spicy soup last week, no, this is different. My wife always says I should drink more water, but I don't see how that would help with the bleeding. Although, now that I think about it, wasn't there a commercial on TV once for some kind of... hemorrhoid cream or something? 

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! The itching and irritation down there's been driving me mad. Can't even sit still without fidgeting. And don't even get me started on the pain. Throbbing like that one time when I got a toothache... oh boy, it was terrible.

Bloody stool, just what I need. More problems.

What was for lunch today? Wasn't it Tuesday? Oh dear, I always get those days mixed up. Anyway, my stool's been bloody and painful. And after, well... It's just a mess down there. (chuckles) Sorry to say that out loud. Can't help but think of when I was younger, went to the doctor for some stomach issues, turned out to be food poisoning from that bad chicken. Good Lord...

Now where am I? Ah yes! The soreness and itching... Down there. You know what I mean. It's like a fire burnin' all the time. Can't sit still without thinkin' about it. Made me wonder if maybe it's one of those hemorrhoid things, but my grandma had those and they didn't sound so pleasant either... (trails off)

It's like someone took a big ol' pin and poked me right where it counts. (chuckles nervously) Ah, my wife always says I'm a bit of a worrier...

Anyway, there's been some blood in my stool, too. Not just a little, neither. We're talkin' the works here – red, brown... all sorts of colors, I reckon. And it hurts somethin' fierce to sit down, or even think about sittin' down, if you catch my drift. My poor bottom's been actin' up something awful. (pauses to collect thoughts) Itchin', burnin', scratchin'... Can't seem to give it a break. I tried that cream the pharmacist gave me – you know, for hemorrhoids? No help at all, if you ask me.

Now, let me see... what else was I goin' to say? (pauses, looks around) Ah yes! The garden! My wife's been wantin' me to fix the fence out there. We had a bit of a storm last week and it came down, didn't it? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all turned around...

You know, I was talking to Edna at the senior center yesterday, and she said her sister-in-law's got some kind of issue with her colon or something... but anyway... My butt's been itching like crazy too. I swear, it feels like there's a thousand ants crawling around down there. I've tried everything – Calamine lotion, witch hazel, you name it.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It's in my rectum, I think that's what it is... or is it the anal canal? Oh dear, it's all getting jumbled up now.

Oh dear, yes, my stool. It's been bloody, and I don't know what that means. Is that bad? My doctor friend said something about... (trails off) Oh, I remember! We went to the park last summer and saw those lovely geese. Did you know they're very social creatures?

Anyway... (clears throat) as I was saying, it hurts down there. And my butt, well, it's just been on fire, if you can imagine that. Itchy, irritated... (fidgets in seat) Oh dear, I hope I'm not getting this all wrong.

Now, what was the question? Ah yes, my stool again. Well, it's been bloody and sometimes... (pauses, searching for words) sometimes I think I see things moving around down there. Like little worms or something. Is that possible? (laughs nervously)

No, wait... anyway, it's bleeding. Painful business, let me tell ya...

Always getting into trouble...","I don't know if it's this cold weather or what, but... you know how sometimes your back gets sore from sitting?

I feel like I've had a stomach bug or something. You know, like when you're traveling and everything is different, even your insides are all mixed up? (chuckles) My aunt used to say that was just the body's way of telling you something... uh... something else.

Now, have I mentioned how tired I am lately? I swear, every day feels like it lasts an eternity. And don't even get me started on these new pillows at home – they're too thick and make my neck ache in ways I didn't know possible. (trails off)"

It's just so painful, Doc. And the burning – it's like someone poured gasoline on a fire down there. (laughs nervously) I know that sounds silly, but it really is that bad. And at night... oh boy, that's when it gets even worse. Can't sleep, can't relax... (trails off)

My poor bottom's all sore and inflamed, and I'm getting these little bleeds now, too. Not just a little blood, neither - it's like a tiny trickle of... uh... (pauses) what was I saying? Oh yes! The pain. It's quite, well, uncomfortable, to say the least.

You know, I had some similar problems when I was younger. My cousin Edna, God rest her soul, she had something with her bowels too. Now, I'm not saying it's exactly the same, but... (pauses again) what year is this? 2023, isn't it? No, wait - 2019, wasn't it? Ah, dear me! Anyway, like I was saying... my bowel movements have been quite, well... let's just say they're not as regular as they used to be.","I don't know if I should even... (pauses) You know, my neighbor, Edna, she had something similar once. Now what was it? Ah yes, her rectum! She got some sort of infection, I think. Anyway... my bowel movements, well, they're just not right. Hard to go, you see, and when I do try... (pauses again) Ugh, the pain is just terrible.

And this soreness down there, it's like nothing I've ever felt before. It's always been a bit sensitive, but now... now it's like my bottom's on fire! And to make matters worse, I'm bleeding. Oh dear, I do hope it's not something serious. (chuckles) My husband says I should just eat more fiber, but that's easy for him to say.

You see, I've been eating plenty of... (pauses once more) what was I saying? Ah yes, prunes! I've been drinking prune juice like water. But no matter what I do, it just seems to make things worse. My stomach's all upset and my anus is screaming at me. It's quite embarrassing, really.

And I'm so uncomfortable... (begins to ramble) Did you know that our church has a new pastor? Nice man, but he talks too fast for an old lady like me. Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, this pain and discomfort. It's just not right. I hope you can help me figure out what's going on... (trails off)"

And this bleeding business... (sigh) it's just not right. When I go, there's blood. A lot of blood. Not just a little bit either, no sir. And the discomfort? Oh boy, it's like... have you seen those fancy new mattresses on TV? My bottom feels like that one, all creaky and sore.

Now, let me think for a moment... (pauses) I'm pretty sure I had some prunes for breakfast this morning. Or was that just yesterday? Anyway, my wife said something about fiber supplements, but I don't know if they're working or not. We'll have to ask the nice lady at the pharmacy about those.

Anyway, back to me... (chuckles) it hurts extremely bad, like someone's poking me with a stick all day long. My bottom just can't seem to catch a break. Sorry to bother you with this, but I figure it's about time we talked about it, don't you?"

Now where was I? Ah yes, the bleeding. It's been going on for weeks, months maybe? Time loses track when you're not feeling well, doesn't it? (pauses again) And have I told you about my arthritis? It's acting up something fierce... (mutters to herself) must get more acetaminophen...

Oh dear me, where did I put that tea towel? Ah yes, the pain. It's excruciatingly painful, if you can imagine such a thing. Like someone's pulling on my... um... what do they call it... (laughs nervously again) Oh well, never mind. Just get this over with, would you?"
194,Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,"I've been experiencing a lot of bowel movement issues recently. It's difficult to go, and it hurts when I do. My anus is quite painful, and it has been bleeding whenever I go. It's really painful and I'm really uncomfortable.","You know, doc, I've been having some trouble with my... uh, bathroom habits, if you will. It's been a real challenge lately. Like when I was at the church picnic last week, I saw an old friend from high school and we started talking about our grandkids. But anyway, back to me... (chuckles) My bowel movements have become quite infrequent, and even when I do manage to go, it's like pulling teeth, so to speak. The pain afterwards is just awful. And the bleeding! Oh dear lord, it's like a small war down there. My anus is all sore, you know? (pauses) Now what was I saying about the Johnsons' anniversary party? Oh yes, my symptoms... It hurts when I go, and then some more after I'm done.","I... think it's been... um... two weeks now? No, wait, was it three? Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up... anyway, my bowels, you see, they've been actin' up somethin' fierce. (pauses to adjust hearing aid) Ah, sorry 'bout that. Where was I? Ah yes, bowel movements! It's like tryin' to pass a rock, if you know what I mean. Just won't go no matter how hard I try... and when it does, oh my stars! It's like bein' attacked by a thousand needles in my bottom. (giggles nervously) Not funny, I know.

But seriously, the pain is just awful. And this bleed-in', it's gettin' on my nerves somethin' fierce. My poor anus, it must be all inflamed or somethin'. I remember when I was a young thing... we didn't have all these new-fangled things like toilet paper and whatnot. We used to use newspaper and... (trails off) Oh dear, where's my thoughts gone? Ah yes! Bowels!

Anyway, as I was sayin', the pain and bleeding... it's just not right. And it comes back after every... um... visit, if you know what I mean. (nervously chuckles again) Not that kind of thing, doc! Just to use the loo, like a normal person. But noooo, my body's all wonky and whatnot. Now I'm thinkin' about them new medications they're always talkin' about on TV... what was it called? Ah, yes! Miralax or somethin'? (excitedly) Do you think that might help me?"

No, no, I think it was longer than that... Anyway, goin' to the bathroom is like tryin' to move a mountain. It hurts somethin' awful. (pauses) You know, I used to love raisins when I was a kid... My grandkids still send me packages with 'em in it. (chuckles)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! It hurts, and it's hard to go. And then there's the bleeding... my anus, it's all... (hesitates) you know what I mean. Painful. Excruciating, like my back used to be after that fall I took last year... didn't break anything, but oh boy, it hurt for weeks! Anyway, it bleeds whenever I go. It's quite uneasy, like a naggin' worry in the back of your mind. (pauses) Did I mention I saw the most beautiful sunrise on my way to get my meds yesterday?","(sigh) Oh dear, Doc... or is it Doctor? I always get that mixed up... (pauses) Anyway, my bowel movements have been a real problem lately. It's like, I'm not sure how to explain it... (chuckles) You know what I was thinking about just the other day? My Aunt Edna used to make these wonderful beef Wellingtons at the holidays... (pauses again)

Oh yes, my gut! (laughs) Sorry, Doc. So, I've been having trouble going to the bathroom. It's like, I strain and strain, but nothing comes out. And when it does, ouch! It hurts so much. My anus is all sore and... and... what was that thing I used to call it? Oh yes, inflamed! That's right. It's inflamed and it bleeds. (gets distracted) Did I ever tell you about the time I went fishing with my cousin Bob? We caught a big ol' bass...

Where was I? Ah yes, my bowel issues. So, it hurts when I go, and then there's this burning sensation... (hesitates) Burning, that's right! And bleeding. It's just... (pauses, searching for words) Excuse me, Doc, what's the word I'm looking for? You know, like a burning fire in my behind! (laughs nervously)

I'm getting all sorts of anxious about it, too. My heart's racing just thinking about going to the bathroom. It's... it's just terrible, if you don't mind me saying so. And then there's this other thing... I think it was a while ago? No, wait, it's still happening! (giggles) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up...

(suddenly serious) Anyway, Doc, it's been going on for weeks now, and I just can't take it anymore. Can we... uh... can you help me with that?"
196,Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,I've been having a really hard time going to the bathroom lately. It's really painful and I'm only able to go every few days. There's also a lot of pain in my anus and around that area. My stool has been really bloody and my anus feels really irritated.,"I'm havin' some trouble with... uh... you know what I mean... goin' to the bathroom. It's just not... comin' easy like it used to. Been a few days now, I'd say Wednesday? No, no, that can't be right... must've been Tuesday. Anyway, it hurts somethin' awful when I do try. And this other thing, I don't know if I mentioned it last time... my bottom's all sore and... ouch! Yeah, it's like a burnin' sensation in there.

And then there's the blood. Oh dear, so much blood. Like I said, every little bit is a struggle now. My stool, it's just... well, not right. And this... irritation? Is that what you call it? Feels like someone poured sandpaper on my skin.","I don't know if I'm getting old or what... my bathroom habits have just been all sorts of wrong lately. Painful, that is. Every three days, four at most... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the doctor for my gallbladder? No, no, didn't happen recently. Anyway... it hurts when I go and it hurts afterwards too. This area here, (points to anus), it's just on fire, dear doc. The pain is always there, like a constant companion. Now where did I put those reading glasses? Ah yes...

My stool, well... you wouldn't believe how bad it looks. Blood, everywhere. Can't remember the last time it wasn't bloody. (pauses) Did you know my cousin's husband had hemorrhoids? Big problem for him, but he's okay now. Anyway... that area, where I mentioned before... (taps anus again), feels all irritated and red. Like a rash or something. I've tried cream, but it doesn't seem to help much.

I swear, when I was your age... (chuckles) we didn't have all these problems. Now it's like my body's decided to stage a protest. (laughs softly) Oh dear, I'm getting sidetracked again... You see, doc, it's just this constant pain and discomfort... and that bloody stool... it's really gotten me down."
197,Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,"I've been finding it incredibly difficult recently to use the restroom. I can only go sporadically because it hurts so much. My anus and the surrounding region are also quite painful. My anus feels really aggravated, and my stool has been extremely bloody.","I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but... ah, bother what was the other day? Oh yes, my grandson came by and we had some lovely homemade cookies... anyway...

So, like I said, it's been a bit of an issue using the restroom lately. Some days I can go, others... well, I'll be honest, it just doesn't happen, or if it does, it's quite painful. And not just that, but my bottom's been sore too. You know what I mean? It feels like someone's taken a hammer to it.

Now, the bleeding's been quite bad, I'm afraid. Bright red blood in my stool, and it won't stop. I've tried... uh, when was it again? Ah, I remember now! My sister said something about eating more fiber or some such nonsense. (chuckles) Oh dear...

And let me think for a moment... this has been going on for... um... months, maybe? No, no, it feels longer than that. Anyway, I'm getting old and forgetful, but I do know it's been quite troublesome.","Oh dearie me... (pauses) You know, I think it started about a week ago now? No, wait, was it two weeks? (chuckles) Ah, doesn't matter. Anyway... I've been having some trouble with, well, you know... using the restroom. (pauses again) Can't quite put my finger on when it began, but I'm pretty sure it's been a few days now.

Hurt so much, it does. (sighs) Only goes sporadically, and even then... oh dear... I just can't explain how it feels. It's like... (hesitates) Have you ever had to get up in the middle of the night? No, wait, that's not what I meant at all. (laughs nervously)

Anus is all irritated, yes, irritated's the word. Surrounding area too. My goodness, it's just... (pauses once more) You know, my sister-in-law Edna had something similar when she was younger... no, wait, that wasn't her at all. Anyway... Ahem, yes... pain is quite... unbearable, really.

My stool's been an awful mess. Bloody, it's been. Extremely bloody, I'd say. (pauses to collect thoughts) Would you believe I almost forgot my grandson Jimmy's birthday is next week? (chuckles) Oh dear...

And that's when I realized... uh... where was I going with this again? Ah yes! My bathroom troubles. So, as I was saying... it hurts, and I've been having such a hard time... Can't quite remember the words for all of this... (fidgets in seat)"
198,Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,I'm having a lot of trouble with constipation and pain while trying to go to the bathroom. It hurts a lot in my anus and the area around it. My stool has been bloody and my anus is really irritated.,"Dearie... I'm having such trouble with, you know, going to the bathroom lately... (pauses) My husband always says I was just like my mother, never regular... anyway... (chuckles) Oh, where was I? Ah yes! Constipation and pain, it's terrible. Hurts a lot in my anus and around there. It's like someone's stuck a knife in me. And the bleeding... (pauses again) I think it started about two weeks ago? Or was it last month? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, details don't matter, does it? The important thing is it hurts! My stool's all bloody and my poor bottom's just so irritated...","Oh dearie me, Doc... *ahem* excuse me, I've been havin' some troubles with my bathroom habits, if you know what I mean. Constipation, it seems like, and oh boy does it hurt when I try to go! It's like a big ol' rock stuck down there, ya know? (pauses) Wait, where was I puttin' that jar of cookies...? Ah yes, anyway...

This pain in my anus, it's just terrible. And the area around it, too – it feels all inflamed and sore. Like someone's been scratchin' me with a rake or somethin'. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I used to have a big ol' garden out back... oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes!

And the stool itself? Well, it's been bloody, Doc. Can't recall the last time I saw blood in my stool, if you don't mind my askin'. Must've been when I had that stomach bug all those years ago... (pauses) Or was that when I fell down them stairs? Oh dear, got a bit mixed up there for a sec!

Now, let me get this straight – what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes! The pain. It's really irritatin' my anus somethin' fierce. Like someone poured vinegar on it or somethin'. (laughs) Vinegar, I remember when I used to make pickles in the summer... (trails off)

I'm gettin' a bit forgetful these days, if you don't mind me sayin', Doc. Must be the medication I take for my knee... or is it the other way around?"
199,Dimorphic Hemorrhoids,"Constipation and bowel movement discomfort have been very common for me lately. The region surrounding my anus and I both ache a lot. My anus is really itchy, and my stool has been bloody.","I'm so glad I came in today... I've been having these problems with my, uh, bowel movements, you know? Can't seem to go like I used to. It's been a while now... let me see if I can remember how long it's been... (pauses) Hmm, was it the day of my grandkid's birthday party? Or maybe the week before that? Anyway, it's been a struggle. My tummy's all achy and so is... (taps area around anus) this spot. It's like a burning sensation, you know? And to make matters worse, I've got this awful itch down there. Can't scratch it enough! (chuckles nervously) And my stool, dear me... it's been real bloody lately.

You know, I was talking to my sister-in-law the other day and she said something about her brother having a similar issue. But what was his name again? Tom or Mike? Ah well... anyway, I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on.","I don't know if you remember me from last time... Oh dear, I'm gettin' old, my mind's not what it used to be.

(hesitates) bowel movement discomfort, that's the term you young folks use these days, right? (chuckles)

It's been happenin' a lot more often than I'd like to admit. The region around... (pauses again) my, uh, bottom, it hurts somethin' awful. And not just hurtin', but achin'. Like when you get that cramp in your back after liftin' somethin' too heavy. You know what I mean? (trails off)

And to make matters worse... (pauses once more) Oh boy, my anus is itchin' like crazy! Can't even sit still without thinkin' about scratchin'. My stool's been bloody, too. Not just a little bit, mind you. A lot of blood. I'm gettin' worried, doc... or was that last year? (laughs nervously) Lord have mercy, my brain's like a sieve these days...

Where was I? Ah yes, the pain and itchiness. It's not just when I'm usin' the bathroom, neither. It's all day, every day. I'm startin' to feel like an old horse, always goin' back in the pasture... (pauses again) Oh dear, I'm gettin' sidetracked. Just tell me what I need to do, doc."

He said I should be careful because... (trails off)

Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up. Where was I? Ah yes, my muscles. They ache like nobody's business. And this stiffness in my joints... it's like trying to walk with concrete shoes on. I remember when I was young, I could run for miles without breaking a sweat. Now, just walking to the kitchen is an ordeal.

I think I had some of that medicine they gave me last time... you know, for the pain? Or was it the swelling? (chuckles) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up all the time. Anyway, my joints have been swollen like sausages. It's quite embarrassing, to be honest.

Wait, what were we talking about again? Ah yes, walking. It's just so... uncomfortable. Like someone's putting pressure on every step I take. And I forget things now too... where did I put that key? (pauses) Oh, I remember! It was in the drawer... no, wait, it was in my purse... (laughs)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my joints. They're swollen up somethin' fierce. And every time I try to move around, it's like someone's tightened up all the springs inside me. (chuckles) Just like that old rocking chair on my porch... Never mind.

Oh dear, I'm gettin' all tangled up in my thoughts. Painful to walk, that's what it is. Like someone's jabbin' needles into my joints.

Those were the days...

Now, about this stiffness... it's not just my neck, mind you. My joints... they're all swollen up like balloons. (pauses, distracted) Did I tell you I saw a movie with Clark Gable last night? No, wait, that was years ago. (laughs) Never mind.

Walking's become quite the ordeal. Every step feels like I'm carryin' a heavy load on my feet. And the pain... it's like someone's stabbing me in the knees. (hesitates) Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... my legs. They're all achy and whatnot.

(suddenly remembers something else) Oh dear doctor, I almost forgot to tell you about the numbness! My hands go numb when I'm washin' dishes. (pauses again) You know, I used to love doin' the dishes with my sister... (trails off)

As for my joints, they've been swollen like the knees on that old man who walks by our house every day. He's got a big gait, you know? Always limping. And I get this stiffness when I move around, especially in the mornings. It's like my body's telling me to slow down, but I'm not getting any younger! (chuckles)

Walking has been... well, it's excruciatingly uncomfortable, as I said. My feet ache and my back feels like it's creaking all the time. Reminds me of that time I fell on the ice and hurt my back. Or was it my neck? Ah, doesn't matter now.

Now, what was I saying? Oh yes! The pain. It's mostly in my knees, but sometimes it spreads to other joints... or is that just when I overexert myself? Hmm, does that make sense? (pauses) Anyway, I think I might need some of those pills again... you know, the ones for inflammation."

My joints have swollen somethin' awful. Can't even walk across the room without my knees creakin' and groanin'. And them joints ache so bad, I just wanna sit down and rest for hours on end... like I did last Sunday, but then it was Tuesday? (laughs) Oh dear me...

( mutters to herself ) What's that other thing? Ah yes, walkin'. It hurts a lot to walk. (pauses) Now, where's my reading glasses? I swear, they were just here on the...","Oh dearie me... I think I've been feelin' this way for a while now... my muscles, they're just not what they used to be... weak, you know? Like I'm carryin' around weights or somethin'. And my neck! Lord have mercy, it's tighter than a drum. I try to turn my head and it just won't budge. I was thinkin' maybe I should get one of them new-fangled neck stretches... did I already tell you that? No, no, it's okay.

Anyway, as I was sayin', my joints, they're all swelled up somethin' fierce. My knees and elbows and hips, all of 'em. It's like I'm wadin' through mud or water or somethin'. Can't walk without thinkin' I'm gonna fall over. Hurts to move around... oh boy, it does. I remember when my husband was still alive, he'd say ""just take some aspirin"" and I'd feel better in no time... (pauses) Wait, what was I talkin' about? Ah yes! My symptoms!

Now let me think on this for a tick... (pauses again) What else have I got here? Oh yes! My muscles. Weak, weak, weak. And my neck's all tight. Swollen joints. Can't walk without it hurtin'. But you know what they say: ""when life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" Or is that when life gives you... uh... (trails off) 

Oh dear me, I'm gettin' all mixed up in here! What was the question again?"
207,Arthritis,"My neck has been so tense, and I've been feeling like my muscles are incredibly weak. I have trouble moving since my joints have enlarged. To walk has been quite painful.","""My neck's been achin' somethin' fierce, doc... and them muscles in my back, they feel like Jell-O or somethin'. Can't even move without wincin', ya know? (pauses) Oh, I remember when I used to take my grandson fishing on Saturdays. He'd always catch the big ones... anyway... (chuckles) My joints, they're all swollen up now. Can't even put my shoes on like I used to. Walkin's been a real chore lately... pain shoots right through me hip and knee. (pauses again) Now what was that thing we were talkin' about? Ah yes, the medication I'm takin'. Is it still good for this sorta thing?""","Dear me... (pause) You know, I was just thinkin' about my neighbor's cat, Mr. Whiskers... such a sweet boy, always comin' over for treats... (trails off)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my neck... it's been so tense, I swear it's gonna snap one of these days... (chuckles) Can't even turn my head without wincing. And them muscles, oh dearie me... feel like they're made of jelly or somethin'. (pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""Did she get hit by a bus?"" No, no, no! Not the bus... (giggles) although, now that I think about it, I did trip on that loose paving stone last week. But that's not the problem, no sirree. It's these joints of mine... or is it my back? Hmm, might be both, dear doctor... you're so smart. (smiling)

I mean, just walking to the mailbox has become an ordeal. Painful, I tell ya! Like someone's poked me with a pin. (hesitates) Wait, did I mention my sister's birthday was last week? Such a lovely cake she made... now where was I? Ah yes, pain in the joints... or is it just one joint? Can't quite remember...

Now, let me see if I can recall when this all started... Wasn't it after that trip to visit my cousin in Florida? Or was that before? (trails off) Oh dear, sorry about that, gets old tryin' to keep track of these things..."
208,Arthritis,"My neck has been really stiff, and I've had terrible muscle weakness. Due to the swelling in my joints, it has been challenging to move about. Walking has been quite unpleasant.","""Well, doc... my neck, it's been stiff like an old board, if you know what I mean. Can't turn my head without feelin' a twinge. And this weakness business... (pauses to think) I've been havin' trouble liftin' things, like the groceries from the car. My joints, they're all swollen up somethin' fierce... (trails off for a moment) You know, my cousin Edna's husband had rheumatism somethin' awful, poor fella couldn't even pick up his grandkids. (chuckles) Ah, but I'm gettin' ahead of myself... It's been hard to walk around, too... (hesitates) Now, let me think when this started... was it last week? Or the one before that? (laughs) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all muddled! Anyway... (clears throat) Walking's just not pleasant, if you know what I mean. It's like carryin' a heavy load around with me.""","I don't know if I should be telling you this, doc... or was it the nurse? Anyway, my neck, it's been stiff for a while now. Must've been three weeks, four maybe? Hard to keep track of days anymore... (pauses) What's that noise outside? Ah yes, sorry about that. So, my neck, like I said. Stiff and all. Then there's this weakness in my muscles. Can't even lift my arms properly no more. (chuckles) Remember when I used to be able to lift those heavy pots from the garden? My grandkids would help me carry 'em... (trails off)

And my joints, they're all swelled up like balloons! It's like I'm 80 again, not 82. (laughs) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, walking. It's a chore now. Every step feels like someone's stabbing me in the hip. Unpleasant doesn't even begin to describe it... (pauses, collecting thoughts) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She had something with her neck too... or was it her back? Oh well, doesn't matter now.

You see, doc, I've been having these... these... uh, what's the word I'm thinking of? Ah yes! Spells! That's right. These spells where everything gets all foggy and hard to focus. Can't even remember my own name some days... (giggles) Oh dear me! I mean, it's not funny, but... anyway... So, that's what's been going on with me lately. (fades off) Now, have you seen my dentures?"
209,Arthritis,I've been feeling really weak in my muscles lately and my neck has been really stiff. My joints have been swelling up and it's hard for me to move around without feeling stiff. Walking has been really painful too.,"You know, doc... I've been feelin' kinda weak in my muscles lately... can't even carry my groceries without gettin' winded... and my neck, well, it's been really stiff, you know? Can't turn my head none too easy no more. (pauses) Oh, I was talkin' to Mabel the other day, and she said her sister's got the same thing... or is it her brother? Hmm... anyway... And then there's these joints of mine... swellin' up somethin' awful... makes me feel like a balloon ready to pop. Can't even walk down to the mailbox without feelin' stiff. (chuckles) Stiff, that's the word!","I don't know if I'm tellin' you this right... anyway... so, yeah, I've been feelin' really weak in my muscles lately. You know, like when you're tired but can't even lift your arms? That's what it feels like. And my neck, dearie me, it's been stiff as a board. Can't turn my head without wincin'. My sister-in-law had that once... or was it my cousin? Oh dear, anyway...

And then there's the swelling. Joints just puff up and hurt somethin' fierce. Makes it hard to move around. I mean, simple things like gettin' out of bed or comin' in from the garden... you know how it is. Feels like my joints are creakin' like an old house.

And don't even get me started on walkin'. That's just about the worst part. Every step feels like I'm gonna collapse. And at night, after I go to bed, I wake up with these aches... just all over. My knees, my hips... can't even remember what I did before bed, but it must've been somethin' strenuous. Hmm...

Now where was I? Ah yes! So, this weakness and the pain when movin', it's just gotten worse lately. Not sure if it's the weather or what's goin' on with me... Oh wait, I remember now: I did start that new exercise video last month... maybe that's it. But then again, wasn't it just my back from all them years of bendin'?"
210,Arthritis,"Recently, my muscles have felt quite weak, and my neck has been really tight. I have swollen joints and find it difficult to move about without becoming stiff. It has also been really uncomfortable to walk.","""Ah, doctor... I mean, Dr. Smith, not that other one, you know... anyway. My muscles have been feeling quite weak, like after all those years of gardening in my backyard. And my neck, oh dear, it's been really tight, tighter than when I had that fall down the stairs last winter... or was it spring? Hmm... doesn't matter. Swollen joints, you see, and they ache something awful. Makes it hard to move around without getting all stiff. Can't even take a walk around the block without wanting to sit down. And my knees, good heavens, I think I may have hurt one of them when I was carrying those groceries... um, what was the date again?""","I don't know if I should be tellin' you all this, but... my muscles, they just feel so weak, ya know? Like when I try to lift a bag of groceries, it's like nothin's in there. And my neck, oh boy, it's been stiff as a board for days. I've had some of them heat wraps on it, and I even did one of those, uh, what's it called... exercises with the ball? You know, to loosen up the muscles?

Now, let me think back... when was this startin'? Was it around that time we went to visit our grandkids in Florida? No, wait, that was last year. Or was it... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now.

Anyway, like I was sayin', my joints, they're all swollen up somethin' fierce. And when I try to walk, or even just move around the house, it's like my body's puttin' up a fight against me. Stiffness, that's what they call it, right? I get these little twinges in my knees and elbows, too.

You know what would be nice? A nice warm bath. That usually helps with all this... (pauses) Wait, where was I goin'? Ah yes, the walkin'. It's just so uncomfortable now. My feet ache somethin' awful, and it's hard to even get out of bed in the mornin'.

Oh dear, I'm forgettin' what else I wanted to say... (chuckles) Oh well, I reckon you'll figure it out."
211,Arthritis,"I've been experiencing muscular weakness and stiffness in my neck recently. My joints have swollen, making it difficult for me to walk about without becoming stiff. Walking has also been excruciatingly uncomfortable.","""Doc... I don't know if it's been two weeks or three, but anyway... my neck's been acting up somethin' fierce. Muscles feel all weak and stiff, like they're tied in knots. And these joints of mine... (pauses to think) ...my knees? No, no, it's my hands, too! Swollen right up like sausages. Can't even walk without gettin' this awful stiffness. It's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I don't know what. My granddaughter was just here visitin', and she said... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the name of that new restaurant? You know, the one with the good soup? Ah yes! We went there last week... or was it a month ago?""","I don't know if I should be telling you this, but... (pauses) Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, my neck. It's been acting up something awful. Muscular weakness and stiffness, that's what it is. Stiffness in the joints, can't even move my head without feeling like it's goin' to snap. (chuckles nervously)

Now, let me think... (pauses) I had a cousin who had something similar, I'm pretty sure. Her name was Edna... no, wait, that's not right. My sister-in-law's sister had this problem. Or was it the neighbor? (laughs) Oh dear, I get mixed up sometimes.

Anyway, my joints have been swellin' like balloons. I know they've been swollen 'cause I can feel 'em under the skin. And when I try to walk... (pauses, searching for words) Excuse me, what was that thing... Ah yes! It's excruciatingly uncomfortable. That's a big word, isn't it? (chuckles)

Walking used to be easy as pie, but now... (shakes head) It's like my legs are made of lead and I'm stuck in the mud. (pauses again) Now, let me think... where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes, my wife was makin' a nice roast beef yesterday... or was it last week? (laughs)

Sorry, what were we talkin' about again? Oh yes, my neck and joints! You see, it's like this pain is always there, in the background. Like someone's tappin' away on a typewriter, but I can't quite hear the words... you know?"

Hard to say, time sure slips away when you're busy watchin' your garden grow. Now, where was I? Ah yes, my neck! It's been like this since... uh... January? Maybe February?

Like a bunch of rubber bands after you take 'em out and let 'em sit for too long. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I had that awful cold... what was it called again? The flu, no, not the flu... Ah, yes! Pneumonia! (giggles)

Anyway, my neck's been achin' somethin' terrible, especially in the mornin'. And don't even get me started on the stiffness. I feel like I've been wrestlin' with a bear all night long! (laughs) Lord have mercy... My joints, too... they're as big as grapefruits now, I swear! (scratches arm) You see, back in my day, we didn't have all these new-fangled treatments. We just... uh... what was the name of that thing? That pill you take for your bones? Oh yes! Calcium! No, not calcium... or is it? (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, walkin'! It's like tryin' to wade through quicksand. Every step feels like a knife through my joints. And the pain... well, that's just... uh... what's-a-ly? (pauses) Owwwww... You know how sometimes you get these little stabs of pain and you're not quite sure where they're comin' from? That's what I've got! And it's been goin' on for weeks now. Now, would you happen to have a glass of water or somethin'?"

Not you, of course... (chuckles) no offense, young man. Ah yes, the swelling, now I think it started after that nasty fall I had last... um, what month is this, anyway? March, April?

Makes it hard to walk, you know? (pauses again) I used to be able to walk with my granddaughter, Emily, she's such a sweetie... anyway...

Nowadays, I need to take breaks every five feet or so, just to catch my breath. It's like my muscles have given up on me, if you know what I mean. (pauses once more) I remember when I was younger, I could lift a heavy sack of potatoes without breaking a sweat... now those things are heavier than ever! (chuckles)

But anyway, this pain in the neck and back... it's been awful. Makes it hard to sleep at night, too. I wake up feeling like an old lady, you know? All creaky and stiff. (pauses again) Did I tell you about my garden? I planted those lovely roses last spring... they're doing beautifully now...

As I was saying... the pain when walking is just agonizing. I've tried to take it easy, but you can't avoid everything, can you? It's just... (sighs) Oh, dear me, where did I put my reading glasses?

Walking's become quite uncomfortable, too. My back starts achin', and my legs feel all heavy. You know how we used to have them old-timey walkers with the big wheels? Reminds me of my father... (trails off)

Stiffness, everywhere! (chuckles) Even when I'm just sittin' in my favorite armchair watchin' TV. And walkin'? Forget about it! It's like tryin' to wade through quicksand. Uncomfortable, dear doc...uncomfortable is the word I'd use.

Oh dear, I remember one time I was walking the dog, and I tripped over a root. (chuckles) Well, not just any root... a big ol' willow root! Anyway, it's like that now, every step is painful... or at least feels that way.

Walking's been quite unpleasant, you see. And when I wake up in the morning... (pauses again) which one was it? Tuesday or Thursday? No matter, it hurts just the same. My neck and those joints, all aching and sore. Not very pleasant at all.","Oh dearie me... my neck's been acting up somethin' awful. It's all tight like a drum, you know? And these muscles, they just feel so weak. I remember when I was younger, my grandkids would play on the trampoline and we'd jump around together... (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?

Oh yes, my neck! It's been achy for weeks now. My joints, they're all swollen up like big ol' balloons. (chuckles) I had a balloon at my birthday party last year... no, it was my anniversary. Anyway, these swellings make me move funny. Can't walk without gettin' stiff as a board. (pauses to think) Did I have my medication this morning? I could swear I took it...

And then there's the pain when I walk. Unpleasant is the word for it, dear doctor. It's like someone's poking at me with a stick all the time. (rambles off) You know what reminds me of my childhood? We'd have these big ol' picnics in the park... now where was I? Ah yes, walkin'. It's just not pleasant, that's all.

Now, let me see if I can remember... (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue! What were we talkin' about again?"
220,Arthritis,I've been feeling really weak in my muscles and my neck has been really stiff. My joints have been swelling up and it's hard for me to move around without feeling stiff. Walking has been really painful too.,"Let me tell you, doc... or is it Dr. Smith? I always get those two mixed up... anyway... (chuckles) 

I've been feelin' really weak in my muscles, and my neck has been stuck like that (taps neck). You know, like when I was shovelin' snow last winter, and my back went out on me. That was a real pain. Oh dear, what was the date again? We had company over... or was it last week? Ah well...

My joints have been swellin' up somethin' fierce. I swear, I look like I'm 80 years old again! (laughs) And it's hard for me to move around without feelin' stiff. Walking's really painful too. You know, I went to the park with Edna last week... or was it this week? Anyway, my knees just ached somethin' awful after we walked that long path. (pauses) Now where did I put those pain pills...","I've been feelin', uh, weak in my muscles... (pauses) You know what's funny? I used to be able to do 20 push-ups in a row! Now, gettin' outta bed's like climbin' a mountain. My neck, it's all stiff like a board, ya know? Can't even turn my head without wincin'. (pauses again) Did I tell you about that time I saw the Queen of England at the grocery store? No, wait... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yeah! My joints. They're swellin' up somethin' fierce. Can't even move my fingers without gettin' a cramp. And walkin'? Forget about it. Every step feels like someone's stickin' needles in me feet. (pauses once more) Now, what was I talkin' 'bout? Oh right! Walkin'. It's like tryin' to navigate through quicksand. Painful... just painful. Don't know how much longer I can keep this up. You know who else had trouble with their joints? My cousin Edna! She used to have the most marvelous garden full of roses and whatnot... (trails off) Oh dear, what were we talkin' 'bout again?

I'm gettin' tired just thinkin' about it all. Maybe I should get one of them walkers like I saw at my sister's house? No, no... that's just a fad. Don't want to look old and feeble in front of the grandkids. (sighs) Anyway... these pains, they've been goin' on for weeks now. Weeks! Can't even remember what day it is sometimes..."
221,Arthritis,"My muscles have been feeling really weak, and my neck has been extremely tight. I have swollen joints and find it difficult to move about without becoming stiff. It has also been really uncomfortable to walk.","""Oh dear, my muscles... they've just given up on me lately. Weak as a kitten, I swear. And this tightness in my neck, it's like someone's got a grip on it and won't let go. Swollen joints everywhere, I look like a prune in the morning light. Stiff as a board when I try to move around... or was it yesterday? No, no, must've been today. Anyway, can't walk without wincing anymore. Used to be able to take a nice long stroll with Ethel, but now I'm lucky if I make it across the room without needing to sit down... Oh, that reminds me! We had the most wonderful dinner at the senior center last week, roast chicken and all the trimmings. Mmm... anyway, back to my joints. Must be arthritis or something, I've been reading about it in those pamphlets they send me...""","Well, you see... my muscles, they just seem so... weak nowadays. Like I'm carrying around a bunch of weights or something. And my neck, oh dear, it's been feeling all... tight and whatnot. Can't even turn my head without wincing. Now, let me think, when was that last time I had a good night's sleep? Must've been months ago... anyway...

Swollen joints, you see, they're always complaining about something. My knees, ankles, elbows – all stiff and achy. Can't even move around the house without feeling like I'm 90 years old again! (chuckles) Speaks of which, remember that time we went to the lake? No, wait, was it a river? Ah, who cares! Point is, walking's become quite... um... what's the word I'm looking for? Oh yes, strenuous. Like wading through quicksand. Uncomfortable doesn't even begin to describe it...

You know, when I was younger – oh boy, those were the days! No aches and pains to speak of. Just the usual creaks and groans from working in the garden all day. Now... now it's like my body's decided it's had enough. What's that phrase I always use? ""Fighting a losing battle""... no, no, not quite. Ah well, something like that, anyway! Oh dear me, what was I saying again?"
222,Arthritis,My neck has been extremely tight and my muscles have been feeling extremely weak. It is difficult for me to move around without becoming stiff due to my swollen joints. Walking has also been extremely uncomfortable.,"Now, let me tell you, Doc... my neck's been acting up somethin' fierce. It's like someone's taken a tightrope and wrapped it around my throat. Extremely tight, that's what I'd say. And these muscles, they're feelin' weak as a kitten. Can't even move without gettin' all stiff-like... (pauses) You know, just like when I was at the library yesterday? They had one of those newfangled computers, and my grandkid was tryin' to show me how it worked. Anyway...

My joints, they're swollen somethin' awful. It's hard to get outta bed in the mornin', don't you know? (chuckles) Lord have mercy, I think I'm gettin' ahead of myself... what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes... walking. That's another thing altogether. Can't take more than a few steps without feelin' like I've got pins and needles all over. Extremely uncomfortable, that's the only way to put it. (pauses) Now, where did I put my reading glasses...","I'm tellin' ya, Doc... my neck, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Extremely tight, I swear on my grandkids' lives. Can barely turn my head without feelin' like a knot's tied around it. Muscles feel like they're made of jelly, weak as a kitten. (pauses) Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Swollen joints, that's the problem. Joints, not muscles... although, now that I think about it, my knees have been actin' up too. (chuckles) Oh boy, those creaky old bones...

You know what I used to do? (gets sidetracked) Oh dear, I had a lovely garden out back, full of roses and tomatoes. My late wife, God rest her soul... she was the one who tended to it, not me. (pauses) Wait, where's my train of thought gone now? Ah yes! The swelling. It's like my joints are tryin' to tell me somethin', but what?

(muttering to self) I should've taken that aspirin... or was it ibuprofen? No matter, it's all the same when you're this old, right? (laughs nervously) Uncomfortable walkin', is what I'm sayin'. My legs feel like lead pipes. Every step I take, it's like someone's tappin' me on the shoulder, sayin', ""Hey, slow down!"" Can't even walk to the kitchen without wincin' in pain...

(suddenly remembers) I had a friend, Edna, she used to have these... what was it called? Ah yes! Bursitis. She got it from liftin' heavy boxes at the store. (trails off) Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous three-bean salad...?"
223,Arthritis,"My neck has been extremely stiff and my muscles have been extremely weak. As a result of swelling in my joints, I find it difficult to move around without feeling stiff. Additionally, walking has been extremely uneasy.","My neck... (pauses) Oh dear, I was just thinkin' about my garden, I planted those daisies last week... anyway, my neck's been stiff as a board, can't turn my head without wincin'.

Can't even walk without feelin' all achy and uneasy... or is that what they call it? (chuckles) Ah yes, uneasy. Just like when my husband used to take me for walks on the beach... anyway... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My neck and them muscles. It's been this way for a while now... think it started after that fall last month... or was it two months ago? Time gets away from you when you're gardenin' as much as I do...","I'm so sorry doc... my neck, you see... it's just been stiff like a board, I kid you not... can't even turn my head without feeling like someone's twisted me around. And them muscles, they're weak, weak as a kitten. Can barely lift my arms, let alone do any of that yard work I was trying to do.

Now, this joint swelling business... been having trouble movin' around the house, feelin' all stiff and creaky like an old wooden chair. And walking? Oh boy, it's like tryin' to walk on stilts... or maybe it's them new shoes I got. No, no, wait, I had those shoes already when my sister came visit last week...

Anyway, the swelling. It's in all my joints, far as I can tell. Fingers, elbows, knees... even my ankles are feelin' a bit puffy. Don't know how to describe it, but it's like someone poured water into 'em. Now, where did I put that other thing? Ah yes! My grandson Jimmy, he said his friend's uncle has arthritis or somethin', maybe we should ask him...

Oh dear, sorry about this... anyway, the stiffness is just so terrible at night. Can't sleep on my side no more 'cause it feels like my neck's gonna snap in two... and don't even get me started on them dreams! I swear, they say you dream more as you get older... I'm tellin' ya, it's a wonder I remember anythin'...

Oh look, there goes the neighbor's cat... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my neck. It's all around me, doc, and I just wish someone would fix it for me..."

And it's not just that, no sir... walking has become a chore. The stiffness just spreads down into my legs. Can't even remember the last time I took a walk without feeling like I'm 80 again! (laughs) My joints have gotten bigger, if you know what I mean... I think it started after that incident with my hip replacement... was it two years ago? Three? Hmm...

Anyway, walking's become unbearable. It's hard to describe. My neck feels tight all the time, like someone's got a grip on it. (pauses) Now where did I put those reading glasses...","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... *coughs* Excuse me, doc. Or is it a nurse? Anyway... stiffness and weakness in my neck muscles, you see. Can't move 'em like they used to. My joints... *pauses* My wife says they're just getting older, but I think it's more than that. *chuckles* I mean, I've got great-grandkids now, and they say I'm gettin' old too. Can you believe it? Time sure flies.

Now, about this stiffness... *stammers* It's like when I wake up in the mornin', my neck feels all locked up. Can't even turn my head without wincin'. My wife says maybe I got a pinched nerve or somethin'. But what if it's somethin' more? Like that time... *trails off* Oh, you know, when I had the flu? No, no, that was different. It was like my body just gave up on me for a bit.

Okay, focus, Edna... *clears throat*. So, this stiffness and weakness in my neck muscles, it's been goin' on for weeks now. And walkin'? Forget about it! My joints feel all creaky and stiff when I try to move 'em. It's like... have you ever tried to lift somethin' heavy with a bad back? *laughs* Oh boy, that was a while ago... What was the question again?

And, oh dear me... I think I might've forgotten why I came here in the first place. Uh-oh! *giggles nervously*."

And walking, well... it's like I'm 90 years old all of a sudden. (laughs) Unsteady on my feet, stumbling around. Don't know what to do about it, doc. My grandson, Jimmy... no, is it Jimmy or Billy? (chuckles) Ah, yes! Billy. He said I should stretch more. Stretching's not going to fix this, is it? (filler pause) Uh-huh...","I don't know if I should be tellin' you this, but my neck...

My wife always says I'm too old for that nonsense. (chuckles) Oh, speaking of which, did I tell you about the time my cousin's husband... (pauses again) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my neck.

Anyway, these muscles in my neck and shoulders, they feel like lead weights or somethin'. Extremely weak, that's the word. Like I've been doin' all this heavy liftin', which I haven't, 'cause I'm too old for that sort of thing now... (pauses once more) What was I thinkin'? Ah yes! My joints. They're swollen like a balloon or somethin'. Can't even straighten my arms sometimes. And walkin' around? Forget about it. It's all stiffness and creakiness, like an old wooden floorboard. Uneasy, that's the word. Extremely uneasy. (pauses again) Oh dear, I'm gettin' a bit mixed up here... (trails off)

You know what I was thinkin'? We used to go on these long walks when I was a young whippersnapper, out in the countryside... (stops suddenly) What's wrong with me? Stomach's been actin' funny too.

It's not just my neck, though. My joints... well, they've grown some, like a right ol' expansion, you see. So now when I walk, it feels like I'm carrying bricks on my shoulders.

Like it's been put through a wringer. (chuckles to self) My joints have been growing, I swear... or is that shrinking? No, no, I mean they've grown. It's this new thing I read about in the paper. Can't remember what it was called now...

Anyway, walking's become quite the ordeal for me. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I tell you about my grandson's birthday party last weekend? He got a new bike... such a nice boy... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, walking. It's hard to do without getting all stiff and sore. My neck muscles just don't seem to be holding up like they used to. And when I try to turn my head, it feels like there's this big weight pushing against me. Uncomfortable doesn't even begin to describe it... (pauses again) Did we discuss my blood pressure last time? I think it was a bit high...

Weak, like they're made of rubber or somethin'. Can't hardly lift my arm, and don't even get me started on bendin' my knees... that's just outta the question now.

Swollen joints, too. My hands, my feet, all sorts of places. Makes it hard to move around, ya know? I tried to mow the lawn last week, but... (chuckles) Oh boy, that was a mistake! Had to take a break and sit down for hours just to catch my breath. And walkin'? Forget about it! Painful's not even the word. It's like every step's a dagger in me hip. I remember when I used to be able to walk for miles without breakin' a sweat... (pauses, lost in thought) Speakin' of which, where did I put my reading glasses? Must've left 'em in the kitchen...

Anyway, that's been goin' on for months now, doc. Or is it years? Time just flies by, don't it? (laughs nervously) Ah, never mind! Just get to the point: what's wrong with me?!

And then there's this swelling... (pauses again) I think it started with my knees first. Yes, my knees were aching something awful. Now it's my hands and feet too. Can't even walk without feeling like I'm carrying lead weights in my shoes.","I don't know if I'm doing this right... (pauses) Oh boy, let me start again.

(pauses) Wait, no, she was fine till the end. Anyway...

This one doctor said I might have rheumatism or somethin', and now my joints are all swelled up like balloons. It's hard to move around, ya see? My knees creak more than a old wooden floor now. (laughs) Oh boy, I had some fun times on that floor... What was I sayin'? Ah yes! The swelling! So it's makin' me feel like I'm stuck in quicksand, ya know?

And them stairs? Forget about it! (giggles) My grandson loves climbin' stairs. That kid's got more energy than a rabbit! Anyway, walkin's been tough too... (pauses) Now where did I put my keys? Uh-oh... Ah yes, the walkin'. Like I said, it's just not easy gettin' around no more.

What was that other thing the doc said? About movin' and such? (chuckles nervously) I think it's just the old age catchin' up with me. Or maybe it's the arthritis... or is it rheumatism? Shoot, now my head's all cloudy like a foggy day!"

My neck, it feels... solid. Yes, that's the word. Solid. It's been like this for... hmm, how long was it now? A week? Two weeks? Time sure flies when you're old, doesn't it? (laughs)

It's hard for me to move around, you see. My joints are all puffy and achy. I try to walk, but oh dearie me... the pain! It's like someone poured kerosene in my knees. No, wait, was that last week or the week before? (scratches head) Oh well...

I don't know what's going on with me, doc... or, uh, doctor-person. I just feel so... frail.""","Well, you see... (coughs) I've been feeling just dreadful lately.

Now, about these joints of mine... swelling something fierce. Can't even move my fingers without wincing in pain. I swear, I must've pulled a muscle at some point. Or was it arthritis? (pauses) I remember my grandmother having arthritis, terrible thing... she used to walk with a cane...

Oh dear me, what's the word for it... (taps foot impatiently) Ah yes! Rheumatism! That's it! My joints are rheumatic. (excitedly) You know, I think I might've got some of those gout pills from my cousin... no, wait, that was for high blood pressure... (chuckles)

Walking's become a chore, to be honest. Pain shoots up my legs like little knives. Can't even take a stroll around the block without feeling like I'm going to collapse. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Ah well, what's an old gal like me supposed to do? (laughs weakly)

Where was I? Oh yes... so you see, Doc... or rather... my doctor... (laughs awkwardly) I just wanted to make sure you knew about all this... swelling and stiffness. And the neck business... it's just been quite a nuisance... (trails off, lost in thought)"

Oh, yes! My joints. They're all swollen and whatnot. Makes it hard to get around the house. I had to use my cane today, and... oh boy, those stairs are killin' me.

Joints, oh dear, they're all swollen up somethin' fierce. Can't even move without wincin'. My knees, ankles... all sorts of places... it's like the arthritis is just... (shrugs) takin' over, I reckon. Doctor said it was just a normal part of gettin' older, but I remember when my sister-in-law had it, and she went through those big ol' metal hip replacements...

Walkin', you know, that's been the worst. Pain in every step like I'm walkin' on... on creaky floorboards or somethin'. (laughs) Don't mind me, gettin' all mixed up... Oh, yes! My sister, Edna... we went to the lake house last summer... and she had one of those fancy water aerobics classes... I swear, it looked like so much fun... (stares off into space)

Oh yeah! My joints have swollen somethin' fierce. Makes it hard to move around without gettin' all achy and stiff. (chuckles) Reminds me of when I used to garden in the yard... my knees would get like that after hours on the knees, but... (trails off)

Now, let me think... (pauses) What else did I want to tell you? Ah yes! I had the most wonderful cup of tea this mornin'. It was a special blend from the health food store... or was it that new restaurant downtown? (laughs) Oh dear, my memory's gettin' as cloudy as my mind.

Anyway... (trails off) As I was sayin', these symptoms. Stiff neck, swollen joints... and this weakness. It's just so... so... (pauses again) annoying! Annoyin' is the word, ain't it?"

We had a picnic and got caught in that thunderstorm. (chuckles) Anyway...

I've been experiencin' this muscle weakness, see? And my neck's all stiff, like it's been iced up or somethin'. Swellin' joints, too - I'm pretty sure it started with me ankle. Or was it my knee? (hesitates) Oh dear, what was the question again?

And when I try to move around... Well, you know how painful it is to turn a corner in your car? It's like that for me, but everywhere. Especially when I steer... (pauses, collecting thoughts)","I'm so sorry doc... (pauses) I was just thinkin' about my cousin Edna, she had a similar issue with her back, but that was years ago... Anyway, this muscle weakness business, it started about two weeks ago, I'd say... or was it three? No, no, don't mind me, it doesn't matter. (chuckles) The point is, I've been feelin' like I'm carryin' a heavy load all the time.

I wake up in the mornin', and my neck feels stiff as an iron rod... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw that show with Danny Thomas? Oh dear me, what was it called again? (laughs) Ah, never mind. The stiffness, yes... it's like someone poured lead into my joints. Swellin', too. My wife says she hasn't seen me move this slow in years... (chuckles) Years ago, when we'd go on our daily walks...

Movin' around is a chore now... Stiffness after exertion, that's what the young doctor at the hospital said... (pauses) You know, I think it was Dr. Klein, no, wait, it was Smith... Ah, dear me! The pain in my neck and shoulders when I turn or move my head... Now, now, don't you get worried about my back, doc. It's just this one issue we're talkin' 'bout. And steerin', oh boy... It's like tryin' to turn the car with a brick tied around my neck. (laughs) Not funny, I know...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, neck muscles. So they're all tight and weak now. Makes walkin' a real chore. Unpleasant's the word I'm thinkin' of. Can't even take a simple stroll without feelin' like... well, you know how it feels when your back goes out, like that. (laughs) Oh dear me...

You know, I swear I saw my cousin's daughter runnin' on TV just the other day? Young whippersnapper, must've been 25 years old if she was a day. (pauses) What was her name again? Shoot... (mutters to self)

Now where was I? Ah yes, neck muscles. Like I said, it's the joints. Age, you know? My wife says I'm gettin' old and need to slow down... (in a mock irritated tone) Oh, slow down? Me? Ha! I'll show her... (trails off)

Heavy, it is. Like someone's put weights on my neck. Can't even turn my head without feelin' like I'm liftin' a car tire! (chuckles) I swear, my grandkids could use me for a jungle gym, they love climbin' on me and... (stops suddenly) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, stiffness. And walkin', well, that's just miserable. Can't even take a stroll without feelin' like I'm carryin' bricks around my neck. It's like... have you ever seen those old fashioned ice cream wagons?

It's like my joints have matured or somethin', and now they're all achy. Just like that American state I read about in the newspaper – you know, when it got all stiff and whatnot. (chuckles) I reckon that's a bit of a stretch, but... anyway. It's been quite painful to walk these days, too. My hip's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Reminds me of my cousin Edna, she had the same problem after her surgery... or was it my Aunt Mildred? (pauses, looking confused) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up.

I swear, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced I read somewhere that stiff joints are a common problem with... with... um... (taps forehead) what's-it-called – oh yes! Osteoporosis!

Let me think... (pauses) My daughter said something about it being acne? Is that right, doc? Acne? (clears throat) I'm getting confused again. You know what's funny? When I was young, we used to get these big ol' tubs of Neutrogena soap for my skin problems... now they've got all sorts of fancy creams and whatnot.

Oh dear me! Focus, Edna! (laughs) Oh right, the rash. So it's been scurring a lot too? I think that's the word... scurring... no, wait, was it ""scratching""? Yeah, that sounds about right. My skin feels like it's on fire! (distracted) Did I tell you about my new cat, Mittens? Cute little thing...

Oh dear, what was I saying again? Ah yes, the rash. So, doc... or is it doctor? (laughs nervously) You know who else had a lot of skin problems when they were young? My Aunt Mildred! She used to get these terrible dry patches on her legs... just thinking about it makes me shiver...

258,Acne,My skin has recently been severely rashy. Blackheads and pus-filled pimples have blocked it. My skin has been quite delicate as well.,"""Oh dearie me... my skin's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Rashy, I mean, not just a little bit, but all over. Blackheads and those awful pus-filled pimples, they've taken over. My skin, it's like silk, you know? Or at least, it used to be. (pauses) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the rash. It's been there for... um... well, let me see... (chuckles) I think it started after that time I went down south to visit my sister-in-law. Her name's... uh... you know, the one with the yellow house? (laughs) Oh dear, what's her name again?

""Anyway, the rash. It's been a right nuisance. My skin's just so delicate now... like it's got no protection or somethin'. I've tried puttin' on that cream my granddaughter recommended, but...

Severely rashy, I'd say. Can't even remember when it started, but I'm pretty sure it was after that big storm we had last month. Don't know why, maybe something in the air or... or... (trails off)

Now, let me think for a sec... Blackheads and... and... those nasty pus-filled pimples have been popping up everywhere! On my face, arms, neck... even my poor hands. I swear, I was just as smooth-skinned as a baby's bottom until this happened. Now, every time I look in the mirror, it's like... (gasp) ...a war zone!

You see, my skin has been quite delicate, always a bit sensitive, but now it's like... (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I sound silly, don't I? But honestly, just thinking about touching it makes me shudder. I've been using all sorts of creams and ointments, but nothing seems to help for long.

Oh, did I tell you about my aunt Edna's arthritis? No? Well... (starts a tangent) Anyway, that doesn't matter now. My skin, yes! It's just so... so... (stammers) Sorry, where was I? Ah yes, it's like the pores on my face are clogged up with who-knows-what. Maybe I should try one of those new-fangled face masks... or not. I always forget what I do with them after a few uses...

Anyway, Doctor... (pauses again) ...do you think it could be something I ate? Too much sugar? I used to eat sweets all the time when I was younger, and now my skin is paying for it... (chuckles vaguely)"

It's got this rash, all pus-filled pimples and blackheads. And it's scurrying a lot, too. I mean, it's not just a little itch, it's like... (pauses again) Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Ah yes, exfoliatin'. It's like my skin is exfoliatin' itself, but with all these bumps and stuff. (trails off) And don't even get me started on the flakiness...","I'm not sure what's goin' on with my skin... lately I've been gettin' these little bumps... (pauses) You know what I did last week? I went to the grocery store and got some fresh eggs, and I thought to myself, ""Now, Mary, you need to remember where you put them."" (chuckles) Ah, yes... skin. So, it's been a while now... this rash thingy... with pus-filled pimples and blackheads. It's quite... unsightly.

(starts rambling) You know what I used to do when I was younger? I'd go fishin' every weekend... (stops abruptly) Where was I? Ah yes, skin. So it's been... umm... a couple of weeks, maybe more... with these... bumps. And the scurvin', Lord have mercy... my skin is scurvin' like crazy! (pauses to collect thoughts) You see, doc, I think it might be from that new soap I started usin'. Or maybe it's from them new shoes I bought? No, no... that can't be right. (laughs nervously)

Now, let me think for a sec... when did this start exactly? (pauses) Oh dear, my mind is gettin' all jumbled! Anyway, like I said, these bumps are quite... troublesome. And there's this one spot on my arm... (tries to point but can't quite locate the area) You know what it looks like? It's like a big ol' blackhead! (laughs again)

Oh dearie me, I hope you can help me with this doc... (pauses to think of something else) Did I tell you about my grandkids? They're gettin' into all sorts of mischief now that they're at school. One of 'em drew a picture of a cat and it looked just like our old cat, Mr. Whiskers!"

(pauses) You know, I was talkin' to my sister-in-law's cousin, Edna... she had that same problem when she was my age... or was it her daughter? Anyway... (chuckles)

Now, let me think... what else was I sayin'? Ah yes! My skin. It's all scurried up somethin' awful. I mean, it's not just the pimples and blackheads, but... (pauses again) Did I mention I saw that new doctor on TV? He said to always wear sunscreen with a high SPF... or was it 30? No, no, 50! That's right. (smiling)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's all flaky and itchy too. Makes me want to scratch till my skin comes off. (chuckles nervously) I know that sounds silly, but... (trails off) Wait, what were we talkin' about again? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' as clogged up as these pores! (laughs)

Anyway... like I said, doc... my skin's been a bit of a problem. Maybe you could give me somethin' for it? Maybe one of them creams or... or ointments? I'm sure I saw that on TV too... (looks around the room) Now where did I put that remote?"

(chuckles nervously) I remember when I was young, we didn't have all these problems with skin. Just... just the occasional acne. But this... this is something else.

You see, my skin's been really sensitive lately. Even the soap, it makes me break out. And don't even get me started on the sunblock. (pauses) I think I put that on last week... didn't I? Or was it the week before? Hmm... Anyway! My skin's just so... (sighs) fragile, like an eggshell. You have to handle it with care or it'll just crack and fall apart.

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes! Now let me think for a moment... what was the doctor saying again? (pauses, confused) Oh dear, I'm getting old, aren't I?

Anyway, this one... it just started out of the blue, and now I've got pus-filled pimples and blackheads all over my face. My skin's been so sensitive too...

These breakouts, though... they've been comin' on for a while now. I think it's since I started eatin' more sugar, but I don't know if that's just my imagination. My sister always said I was prone to acne, and she had some fancy cream from the doctor... (trails off) But what was I sayin'? Oh right! The breakouts!

Had a rash all over my skin, like somethin' was crawlin' underneath it. And those blackheads, oh boy, they're the size of quarters! Filled with pus, just awful. I tried to wash 'em off, but they just won't budge. My granddaughter told me she had somethin' similar when she was in high school... or was it college? Shoot, I always get those two mixed up... anyway, it was some kind of acne, I'm sure of it.

And my skin's been scurryin', too. You know, like ants on a log. Can't even sit still without feelin' 'em movin'. Now, what day is today? Is it Tuesday or Thursday?

Where was I? Oh yes, the rash! It's got pus in these bumps, and it feels like sandpaper on my skin. Makes me want to scratch till I bleed. (giggles) Just like when I used to catch fireflies with my brother...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the rash. So, it started on my back, but now it's all over me. Arms, legs, even my face. It's like a big ol' patchwork quilt of pimples and blackheads. And they itch something fierce! ( scratches arm) Oh, would you mind if I got some water? My throat's getting dry just thinking about this... (pauses to drink from an imaginary glass)

I remember when my mother had skin problems. She used to say it was because she didn't eat enough greens. But I'm eating all the right foods now. Well, mostly... (chuckles) Unless you count that leftover pizza from last night... (laughs) Oh dear me, what's gotten into me today?"

My sister swears by that new stuff from... uh... what's it called? Never mind. The point is, my skin's all dry and red.

I think I might've gotten some of this from eatin' too much cheese, you know? All that salt and fat just can't be good for the skin. My aunt Edna used to say that dairy products cause all sorts of problems... but what was it she said about tomatoes? Ah yes, tomatoes are good for the blood! Anyway...

Now where was I? Oh right. The rash. It's been gettin' worse over the past few days. And now my face is all swollen up too. Can't even see myself in the mirror without lookin' like a... a... you know what I mean. Just not very pretty, that's for sure.

And another thing, do you think it's related to my hip? It's been actin' up somethin' fierce too. All achy and stiff. Maybe it's just old age catchin' up with me, but... well, I guess we'll see about that."

(pauses) I was just thinking about that recipe for chicken soup my sister used to make... (mumbles to herself) anyway...

Oh yes, the rash! This morning, I woke up and it was all over my skin. Now, I know I've had some trouble with acne before, but this is something different. There are blackheads everywhere, and big red pimples that have pus in 'em... (trails off) Did I ever tell you about the time I went to the doctor for a flu shot? I was so nervous I spilled coffee all over my shirt...

What was I saying? Ah yes! The rash. It's itchy too, which is just wonderful at this hour of the morning. And don't even get me started on the scurrying... (pauses) Wait, what do you call that again when your skin feels like it's crawling all over? Like ants or something?

Let's see now... I was thinking about my daughter's birthday party last week... We had the most wonderful cake with pink frosting... (pauses again) Where was I? Ah yes! My skin. It's just been really scurrying, and this rash is getting worse by the hour. Do you think it could be... (hesitates) You know what, Doctor? I don't even remember what we were talking about anymore...

Oh dear, I hope I'm not forgetting something important! (chuckles nervously)"
272,Acne,I've been struggling with a really nasty rash on my skin lately. It's covered in blackheads and pimples that are packed with pus. My skin has also been really scurrying.,"I've had this rash on my skin for... um... well, I think it started after that big dinner party at my niece's house last month? Or was it two months ago? Oh dear, I always get those dates mixed up. Anyway, this rash has been really bothering me. It's all covered in blackheads and pimples, and they're just packed with pus! Just terrible looking.

You know, I had a cousin who had something like that once... I think it was my cousin Edna? No, wait, I mean Emma. Yes, Emma had a rash like this, but she went to one of those fancy clinics in the city and got all sorts of treatments. Oh, what's the word I'm thinking of... dermatologist? Anyway, her skin looked lovely again after that.

But mine... oh dear me... it's just been scurrying around on my body. My back, my arms, even my face! It's just a mess. And it hurts, too. Especially when I put on my favorite blouse with the nice buttons. The buttons always seem to get caught in these pustules.","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, doc... (pauses) You know, I was just talking to my sister-in-law Edna about her arthritis... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, the rash! It's been driving me crazy. Covered in blackheads and pimples... packed with pus, I'm tellin' ya. (pauses again)

Now, let me think... where did I put my reading glasses? (laughs) Ah, doesn't matter! What matters is this awful rash. My skin has been scurrying... you know what I mean? Like ants on a picnic blanket. And it's not just the face, doc. It's all over: arms, legs, even my poor backside. (chuckles) Lord have mercy, I hope I don't get a rash where it counts! (giggles nervously)

Now, what was that other thing? Oh yes... my niece's cat got into some trouble last week... (pauses once more) Wait, no! Focus, Helen! You're here about the rash. So, as I was sayin', my skin feels all itchy and... and... scaly. Like a frog, you know? And it's been like this for weeks now. Weeks! I swear, my granddaughter Emily would have had that fixed by now with one of them creams or ointments she's always talkin' about... (stammers) Now what was the name of that thing again?"
273,Acne,I just developed a really nasty rash on my skin. There are tons of blackheads and pimples that are filled with pus. My skin has also been really scurrying.,"Oh dear... I think it started last week? No, wait, was it two weeks ago? Anyway, my skin, it's just been acting up something fierce. Got this rash all over me, and let me tell you, it's a doozy. Blackheads, pimples, they're all filled with pus, just like when I used to get them as a teenager... (chuckles) Oh boy, those were the days...

Uh, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's been scurrying, is what I'd say. You know, like ants in your kitchen, but on me! And it's so itchy, it makes me want to scratch myself silly. Now, I think I saw that new doctor down the street, you know, the one with the mustache? I always forget his name... anyway, he said something about taking some cream or ointment for my skin, but I don't rightly remember what it was called... (sigh) Oh well, I'll just have to trust him on that one.","I'm so sorry, Doc... I just got back from my garden, and you know how it gets all dry out there this time of year? Reminds me of when I was a kid, we'd go swimming in that pond near our house, and get all pruney... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yes, the rash. It's just terrible. Blackheads and pimples everywhere. And they're full of pus! Like those old zits I used to get when I was young... you know, before I got married? My husband always said I had a clear complexion, but... (chuckles) anyway...

And my skin has been all itchy, scurrying, like ants on my back. Not just on my face, mind you. All over. It's just so uncomfortable. I've tried applying some of that aloe vera cream, but nothing seems to be working. And the worst part is... (pauses) Oh dear me, what was it? Ah yes! The itching keeps me up at night. Just like when my mother had arthritis, her joints would ache all night long...

You know, I think I might have left something on the stove... or was that just yesterday's soup? Ugh, my mind's going blank now. (laughs nervously) Forgive an old person, Doc. Anyway, this rash has been with me for... um... three days? Five? Time just flies when you're having fun... doesn't it?

Oh yes! I remember what I was saying about my skin! It's all red and inflamed, like those poor roses that get too much sun in the garden. And these blackheads, they're not even small anymore. Just huge, painful lumps on my neck and shoulders... (whispers) Oh dear... it's just terrible..."
274,Acne,I've been dealing with a really nasty rash on my skin lately. It's covered in blackheads and pimples that are packed with pus. My skin has also been really scurrying.,"I've had this rash on my skin for... um... well, I think it was last week? Or maybe two weeks ago? Anyway, it's been bothering me something fierce. It's all covered in blackheads and pimples that are just packed with pus. My granddaughter said it looked like a big ol' zit fest. (chuckles) She's got some kind of... uh, what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Ah yes! Acne medication now. Reminds me, my sister-in-law's daughter had some issues with her skin too...

Oh, right, this rash. It's been scurrying across my skin, if you know what I mean. (laughs) My doc said something about it bein' a sign of somethin', but I don't rightly recall... You know how it is when your mind goes blank? (pauses) Wait, where was I? Oh yes! So it's itchy and red, too. I've been tryin' to get some cream for it, but it just won't seem to clear up...","I don't know what's going on with my skin no more... It's all scurrying like ants, I swear. And these blackheads, oh boy! They're huge, just huge! Filled with pus, you can see it oozin' out. My granddaughter had that when she was a teenager, but this is different. This is like... well, I think I got some cream for it from my sister's cousin, but then again, maybe I already used it up.

You know what else? I haven't been to the bathroom like normal lately. It's all... ah, what's the word I'm thinking of? Ah yes! Constipated! I'm as constipated as a bear in winter. (pauses) Wait, where was I going with this? Oh right! My skin. And these blackheads, they're not just on my face neither. They're all over my arms and neck too.

I remember now, I went to the doctor last week for... uh... what was it again? Ah yes! A check-up! But I didn't tell him about this rash business. Maybe I should've, huh? (pauses) You know who's good with skin stuff? My niece-in-law, she works at that new dermatology place downtown. Maybe I'll give her a call...

Now where was I? Oh yes! This scurrying feeling... it's like my skin is alive or something. Like there's tiny creatures crawlin' all over me. (chuckles nervously) I know it sounds crazy, but I swear that's what it feels like.

Anyway, can you help me with this rash business? Get rid of these blackheads and scurrying skin? Please..."
275,Acne,I've recently developed a terrible rash on my skin. It's riddled with blackheads and pus-filled pimples. My skin has also been scurrying everywhere.,"I'm afraid I've got this...this rash thing on my skin now. It's just terrible, doc. Got blackheads and pus-filled pimples all over. And it's, uh, scurrying everywhere, like I said before... (pauses to collect thoughts) You know, I was watching that show about the Great Depression yesterday? Fascinating stuff...my grandson was telling me about it too... (trails off)

Anyway, my skin's been acting up something fierce. Now, where did I put those pictures of my garden? (chuckles) Oh dear, I think I might have left them at the retirement home's craft class...

Oh yes, this rash! It started a week ago, maybe two weeks...or was it last month? (laughs nervously) Time gets away from me sometimes. My skin just seems to be breaking out in all these bumps and pimples...and it hurts, I must say...","I don't know if I should be talking about this, but I've got a rash... thing on my skin. It's all over me, I think. (pauses) Did I already tell you about it? No, no, I'm sure I didn't. My granddaughter was just here, and she said I looked like I'd been playing with paint. (chuckles)

Anyway, the rash... (clears throat) It's got these big ol' blackheads on it, and they're all... scaly. And pus-filled pimples too. Just awful-looking things. My sister had something like that once... or was it my cousin? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's been spreading, I think. (pauses to collect thoughts) You see, it started on my arm, and now it's all over me. My skin has... has been feeling funny too. It's like it's scurrying around under my clothes or something. Like when you put on a new pair of shoes and they feel all scratchy inside? That's what this feels like. (nods) I'm sure that's it.

Oh, wait! I remember now – I went to the doctor for a check-up last week, and he said everything was fine... except my blood pressure. It was a bit high, but he said we could talk about medication later. (trails off) I wonder if that's related?"
276,Acne,I recently had a horrible rash on my skin. There are several blackheads and pus-filled pimples. My skin has also been moving around a lot.,"You know, I've had this rash on my skin for... um, let me think... was it last week? No, wait, two weeks ago? Anyway, it's been bothering me something awful. There's these big blackheads and pus-filled pimples all over the place. I'm not one to complain about a little acne, but this is different. And my skin, it's been moving around... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing with my grandkids? We caught the biggest bass in the lake! Oh dear, anyway...

As I was saying, these bumps are all over my arms and chest. They hurt when I touch them. And sometimes they bleed a bit. My skin feels like it's crawling, if that makes any sense. (pauses) Now, where did I put those reading glasses? Ah yes... I'm getting on in years, I suppose.","I'm gettin' all sorts of trouble with my skin lately... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Oh yeah, my rash. It's been a doozy, let me tell you. Got several blackheads and those pus-filled pimples... just ugh! And don't even get me started on the movin' around part. (chuckles to herself)

You see, I was at the grocery store the other day, and I saw this lovely lady with a big ol' basket of fresh fruit. Reminded me of my sister when we were kids... she used to love pickin' strawberries in our backyard. (pauses) Oh dear, where's that recipe for strawberry shortcake? I swear I had it written down somewhere...

Anyway, back to the rash. Like I was sayin', it's been all over the place – on my face, neck, arms... and those blackheads! They're just so... stubborn. (pauses) Did I mention I went to the early bird special at Denny's yesterday? Such a great deal on the coffee refills! (laughs)

Where was I? Ah yes, my skin. And it keeps movin' around. Like, literally, it moves from one spot to another... don't know what's causin' it. (frowns) You'd think I could just sit still for five minutes without this happenin', but no... (shrugs) My doctor at the time said somethin' about... uh, what was it? Oh yes! Eczema! Maybe that's it. Or is it psoriasis? Shoot, I always get those two mixed up...

(pauses to collect thoughts)

Oh dear, this rash has been a real nuisance. (pauses again) Now, where'd I put my reading glasses?"
277,Acne,"This morning when I woke up, I discovered that I have an extremely bad rash all over my body. There are several pus-filled pimples and blackheads all around. My skin has also been moving around a lot.","Now, let me tell you... I woke up this mornin', and I looked in the mirror... (pauses) My granddaughter was here last night, she was helpin' me with my medication... anyway...

I saw these big red blotches all over my body, and at first, I thought it was just a heat rash from takin' that new blanket to bed. But then I looked closer, and there were these little bumps... pus-filled pimples, my friend Edna's got those too, I swear she said they went away after she used that cream...

And don't even get me started on the skin. It was all over the place, movin' around like it had a mind of its own! (chuckles) Reminds me when my husband... oh dear, anyway... the rash, yes... so I'm thinkin', could be some kind of infection? Like that one time... I forget what it's called... the doctor said somethin' about... uh...","I don't know what's gotten into me this morning... (pauses) Did I remember to water my roses? I hope I didn't forget again. (chuckles) Anyway... My skin, it's all... red and inflamed. Like when I was at the beach that one time with Margaret, and we got sunburned so badly. Ugh, my poor shoulders still ache thinking about it. (pauses)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this rash! It's everywhere. Pus-filled pimples and blackheads all around... (hesitates) Blackheads, just like those nasty things that got stuck in the filter of our old vacuum cleaner. You remember that thing, don't you? (trails off)

Anyway, my skin has been... squirming around a lot. Yes, that's it! Squirming. Like when I was a kid and used to watch those... those... (stammers) what were they called? Oh yes, marionettes! Those puppets with strings, remember? My skin feels like one of those marionettes, all twisted and... (shrugs)

Now, let me think... this rash started... when was it now? Yesterday evening? No, no, I could've sworn it was during the dinner party at Bill's place. Or was it last week? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank. All I know is that I woke up this morning and... (pauses, looks around) where are my slippers?"

My skin has also been scurrying about.,"I don't know what's gotten into me... woke up this mornin' and my skin was...

It's all red and sore, with these big blackheads and pimples filled with pus. And it's been itchin' somethin' fierce. (chuckles) My neighbor, Mrs... uh... what's her name again? Oh dear, it'll come to me... anyway, she said I should try that new cream for dry skin. But this isn't just dry skin, is it? No, no... it's been scurrying about, all over my body. Yes, scurrying. That's the word. Like little critters on my skin.","I woke up this morning... I don't know what time it was, I wasn't keepin' track of that... anyway... my skin. It was like nothin' I've ever seen before. There were these big black spots all over me. I thought maybe I'd gotten into some poison ivy or somethin', but then I saw there was pus in 'em too. Like little volcanoes, you know? And don't even get me started on the itch... (pauses) Oh boy, that's a real doozy...

Now where was I goin'? Ah yes, the rash! So like I said, it's all over my skin. Even my face. My poor face. I look like I've been sleepin' in the mud or somethin'. And this other thing... (pauses again) You know what? I'm gettin' ahead of myself here. What was I talkin' about again?

Oh, right! The rash. So like I said, it's covered in blackheads and pimples with pus inside 'em. And don't even get me started on the... (pauses once more) Wait a minute. Where did I put my slippers? I could've sworn I left 'em right here by the bed...

Now where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's been actin' strange too. Like it's got a life of its own or somethin'. (chuckles) Scurry about, that's what it does. I know it sounds crazy... but I swear, sometimes I feel like my skin is movin', you know? Squirmin' around under there... (trails off)

Anyway... I'm gettin' a little mixed up here. What was the question again? Oh boy, I hope I didn't miss anythin'."
279,Acne,I've just developed a skin rash with several pus-filled pimples and blackheads. My skin has also been quite sensitive.,"""Oh dearie me, Doc... I've just developed this skin rash and it's got me all worried. Got these pus-filled pimples and blackheads, you see. Don't know what caused it, but my skin's been sensitive for a bit now. Can't remember when exactly, but I think it started after that trip to the beach last week... or was it two weeks ago? Anyway, I've been getting these spots on my face, neck, and arms. And oh boy, they itch like crazy! Reminds me of when I was younger and had those awful acne flare-ups during puberty... (pauses) What was that other thing I wanted to tell you about? Ah yes, the rash. It's just so frustrating, feels like my skin is on fire sometimes.""","I don't know what's goin' on with my skin, Doc... I woke up this mornin', felt like a million bucks, and then I looked in the mirror... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Oh yeah, my skin! It's all... itchy. And red. Like a big ol' tomato. (chuckles) Get it? Tomato? (trails off)

Anyway, these little bumps started showin' up. Pus-filled pimples and blackheads, just like you said, Doc. I remember when I was a kid, my sister had acne something awful... (starts to reminisce) We'd go out in the backyard and pick wildflowers, and she'd always get a rash from them... (pauses, confused) What were we talkin' about again?

Oh yeah, my skin! It's so sensitive now. Even my old flannel shirt gives me hives... (laughs nervously) I think that's what they're called? Hives? (chuckles again)

You know, it reminds me of the time I... uh... went on a picnic with my wife. We had a lovely time, but she got some sunburn and we had to put aloe vera all over her. Now I'm thinkin', is this sunburn or what? (laughs once more) Oh dear...

Oh, and there's one big one here, Doc... (points) See that? Like a little volcano erupting! (excitedly) And it's so sore to the touch... like when I burn my tongue on hot coffee. You know how that is? (pauses again)"

(pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, this rash. It's been gettin' worse, I think. No, it started after that one family dinner... or was it before? My niece, Margaret? Anyway, I'm pretty sure I got the recipe from her cousin's wife. (pauses again) Filler cream, you see. They make all sorts of creams these days.","I'm so glad I came in today, Doc... (pauses) ...my mind's been a bit of a jumble lately. You know what they say about getting older, ""it's all downhill from here.""

Lord have mercy, I've scratched till I'm raw. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now what was I saying? Ah yes... my skin's been scurring a lot lately. That's not even a word, is it? Scurring? (chuckles nervously) Must be from all that baking I do.

You know, I was making my famous sugar cookies for the church bake sale last weekend... anyway... my skin. It's all red and inflamed. And these bumps keep getting bigger! (gets anxious) What if it's something serious, like cancer or one of those skin cancers? My cousin had that thing on her face... melanoma, I think it was called. (pauses to take a deep breath)

I'm so sorry, Doc. I get sidetracked sometimes. It's just that my mind is like an old attic – all cluttered up with memories and worries. (laughs) Now where was I? Ah yes, the rash! You see, it started on my arm... no, wait, it started on my chest... or was it my neck? (trails off)

Blackheads and pus-filled pimples all over the place. My skin's been changing a lot lately too. You know, I've always had some acne as an old person, but this is different. It's like my whole body's breaking out in boils. And it itches something awful... (pauses) Oh, what was that thing I'm supposed to remember? The word for when you get a rash all over...

Anyway, I woke up with all these bumps and blisters. Blackheads, they're callin' 'em blackheads, I think. Yeah, that's what the nurse said last time I saw her. And pus-filled pimples everywhere... (looks around) Where's my walker? I could've sworn I left it right here...

My skin's been changin' a lot lately, like I said. (pauses) Now let me think about this... Have you seen that new park downtown? We should take a walk there one of these days... (trails off)

Oh yeah! The rash. (taps foot again) It's itchy, too. Can't stop scratchin' at it. I've been tryin' to use some cream, but it just keeps comin' back. (hesitates) You know what's funny? My grandkids used to get those kinds of bumps on their skin when they were young... or was that a different family member? (chuckles) Ah well...

So, I don't know if this is important or not, but I've been feelin' a bit... weak. Not sure how long I can keep goin'. Need to get some rest, I reckon. Oh, and have you seen my favorite cookbook? I could swear I left it right here on the table... (stops talking abruptly)"

Like it was all... flaky. You know when your skin gets like that? (chuckles slightly) Reminds me of that time I had chicken pox as a kid...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, this rash. It started last night, or maybe it was the night before? Time gets away from you after a while... my mind's not what it used to be... (laughs softly)

But this is different. There's pus, lots of pus, and blackheads too. It's all over me like a bad rash. (chuckles) I mean, I've seen worse, but still... My skin's been scurin' somethin' awful. Like sandpaper, that's what it feels like. Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I swear I left 'em right here on the nightstand... (gets distracted and starts rummaging through nearby items)

Some of 'em are even burstin' and weepin', if you know what I mean... (starts muttering to herself) I wonder if I should've worn sunscreen that day... or was it the other way around? Never mind.

Anyway, I think I might've gotten some bug bites or somethin'. Could be allergies too.

And get this, doc – the skin itself seems to be moving! Like ants or something. I swear, I saw one little pimple hop off my arm just yesterday. My daughter was over for dinner, and she said, ""Mom, you look like a plucked chicken!"" (laughs) Ah, kids these days... Where was I? Oh yes, the rash. It's quite itchy too.

Don't rightly know what that means, but it sounds right, don't it?""","I woke up this morning, can't remember what time, must've been late... anyway, I saw this rash on my skin. Horrible thing, like a bunch of blackheads and pimples all loaded with pus. Ugh! And it's not just that, my skin has been scurrying about. Yes, scurrying! Like little ants or something. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to Europe? I walked so much in Paris... (chuckles)

Now where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's all over my face, arms, and legs. I think it started on my back, but now it's spreading like wildfire. (pauses) Wildfire... just like that fire we had last summer. (sighs) My neighbor Mr. Johnson, he was a brave one, put out the flames in no time. (chuckles)

I've been getting these blackheads for years, but this is something different. It's all red and inflamed... (struggles to remember) Oh dear, I think I had some cream or ointment that helped with that stuff. But it's gone now, can't find it anywhere. (mumbles to self) Cream, yes, cream...

Now where was I? Ah yes, the rash! It's so itchy too... feels like my skin is crawling under me. (giggles) Crawling... just like those little creatures I mentioned earlier. (trails off)

I should really get some rest. All this thinking about the rash has exhausted me... (yawns) Wait, what was I saying?"
285,Acne,"This morning when I woke up, I discovered an extremely bad rash on my skin. There are several pus-filled pimples and blackheads all around. My skin has also been moving around a lot.","I woke up this morning... I think it was morning? Or was it yesterday evening? Anyway, I got out of bed and looked in the mirror, and oh my goodness, I had the most awful rash on me! There were these big, sore bumps all over my arms and legs, and they're filled with pus. And there's blackheads too... don't know if that's what they are. My husband says it looks like acne, but he's always getting those new-fangled products on his face, I swear he thinks he's still 20 years old! (chuckles) Ah, yes, the rash... and my skin, it's all moving around a lot. Like, it's squirming or something. I know that sounds crazy, but it feels like it. And I've been feeling so tired lately, too...","I don't know what happened this morning... I woke up early, like I usually do, and... oh boy... my skin... it was all red and angry lookin'... I said to myself, ""What in tarnation is goin' on here?"" And then I saw these big ol' pimples, pus-filled, just bubbly and gross... and the blackheads, Lord have mercy... they're everywhere.

You know, I had a similar thing happen when I was younger. My cousin Edna had it too... no, wait, that was her sister Mildred... anyway... it wasn't this bad, but she said it was from some new soap she started using. I'm not sure if that's the case here... maybe it's something else entirely.

Now, let me see... where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes... now, what were we talkin' about? Oh right! My skin. It's like it's movin' around on its own, all squishy and loose. I know that sounds crazy, but just watch: *taps skin* See how it does this? Like a big ol' wet noodle... (chuckles) Not funny, not funny at all.

My grandson Jimmy told me about some new cream he's been usin' for his eczema. He said it worked like magic. Maybe I should try that... but what if it's just a sign of somethin' worse? Cancer, maybe? No, no, no... I'm gettin' ahead of myself here.

Anyway, the rash started on my arms and legs, now it's spread to my face too. It looks like I've been wrestlin' with a bear or somethin'. (laughs) Oh dear me..."
286,Acne,I've recently been battling a pretty itchy rash on my skin. There are pus-filled pimples and blackheads all over it. My skin has also been scurring a lot.,"I've had this...this rash business for about two weeks now, I think? Time flies by when you're as busy as I am with the garden club. My daughter always says I'm too old for that sort of thing, but I say, why not? Keeps me active.

Anyway, back to my skin...it's been itchin' somethin' fierce! I've got these pus-filled pimples and blackheads all over the place. It's like a plague on my poor skin. And don't even get me started on the scratching – it's scurring a lot, if you know what I mean. I wake up in the middle of the night thinkin', ""What's goin' on with my skin?"" and then I'm outta bed, scratchin' like a madwoman...or at least, that's how my back used to ache, before the new heating pad arrived. I swear by it now.","I'm so sorry to bother you with this, but I've been having the most dreadful itching on my skin, dearie... (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes! The rash. It started a few weeks ago, and it's just gotten worse. There are these big pus-filled pimples all over... (chuckles) You know, like when I was a girl, we used to get those on our knees from playing outside too much. (trails off) My mother would always say, ""Go wash your hands!"" But anyway...

As I was saying, the rash is all itchy and scaly now. And there are these blackheads... what do you call them again? Black spots? No, no, that's not right. (pauses, collecting thoughts) Oh dear, my mind goes blank sometimes! Ah yes, blackheads! They're like little tiny pimples, but dark. (laughs) My granddaughter would get those on her face all the time when she was a teenager.

But this rash... it's been scurring a lot, you see. (pauses again) I'm not sure what that means exactly, but my sister said it sounded like ""scratching""... no, wait, is it ""scouring""? That can't be right! (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now!

Anyway... the rash has been making me feel quite miserable. And I think it's maybe gotten worse since we went to that dinner party last week. You know, at Uncle Joe's? (pauses, lost in thought) I had the most wonderful time... we played bingo! Or was it dominoes? (laughs) Ah yes, and they served those lovely little sandwiches with the crusts cut off..."
287,Acne,"This morning, I realized that I had a major rash all over my body. There are lots of pimples filled with pus and blackheads everywhere, and my skin has been scurrying a lot.","This morning... I think it was this mornin', anyway... I woke up and my skin, it was actin' up somethin' fierce! I had a major rash all over me body, if you can believe it. Pimples everywhere, filled with pus... just like when I had acne in high school, Lord have mercy! Blackheads too, like little black specks all over my face and neck. And get this, doc... my skin's been scurrying a lot, if that makes sense? Like ants movin' around under me skin. Reminds me of the time I saw them fireflies in my grandpa's garden when I was just a young'un... Oh dear, anyway! My skin's all itchy and red, too... what day is today again? Wasn't yesterday Sunday, was it?","I don't know if you're gonna believe me, but I woke up this morning... or was it yesterday? No, no, it was this morning for sure. Anyway, my skin, well, let me start again. My skin has been acting funny lately. I mean, not funny like a joke, but more like... what's the word I'm thinking of... (pauses) Ah yes, scurrying! That's right, scurrying all over my body. Like little insects crawling around under my skin.

Now, about this rash. It's everywhere, honey. Pimples and blackheads galore. And don't even get me started on the pus. I mean, it's like a big ol' zit fest. (chuckles) Oh dear, I remember when my cousin had that same problem... no, wait, it was her sister who had it. Anyway...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this rash. It's all over my arms and legs and back. Even on my face! Can you imagine getting a big ol' zit right between your eyebrows? (laughs) No, no, not exactly. Oh dear, I'm digressing.

What I wanted to say is that it started this morning. I woke up and... (pauses) Wait, what was the word I was thinking of again? Ah yes, pus! It's all full of pus. And the skin, it's like it's alive or something. Scurrying around under my skin. Oh dear, I hope you can help me with this one, doc."
288,Acne,"I woke up today to find that I had a major rash all over my body. There are lots of pimples filled with pus and blackheads everywhere, and my skin has been scurrying a lot.","Doc... I woke up today... or was it yesterday? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' old... anyway... I had this major rash all over me body. Big pimples with pus and blackheads everywhere... (pauses to adjust her glasses) My goodness, I had the most wonderful chicken parmesan at the community center last week... (trails off) 

Oh, right! The rash. Yes, it's been scurryin', I guess that's what you call it when your skin's all flappy and whatnot. Don't know if it's from the sun or just gettin' old... my sister Edna always said we should wear hats in the summer... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, this rash business...","I don't know if I mentioned this before, but my grandson's birthday party was last weekend... (pauses) Oh, yes! The cake was lovely. Anyway, today I woke up with this terrible rash all over me. Pimples and blackheads, everywhere. I'm not sure what it is. My skin has been acting funny lately, too. Like it's scurrying around on its own. (chuckles) Get a picture of that!

You know, I had a similar rash once, but I think it was from that time my husband... (pauses, looks around the room) Oh dear, where did I put that recipe for his favorite soup? Ah yes! It's in this kitchen somewhere... Anyway, as I was saying, this rash. My skin is just so... irritated. And hot. I feel like I'm on fire. (fidgets)

Now, what was the question again? Oh dear, I'm all mixed up today. Did I take my medication? I think I did... or was it yesterday? No matter. This rash is what's bothering me. The pimples are filled with pus, and they hurt like the devil. And don't even get me started on the itching! (scratches arm) Oh dear, I'm getting a bit carried away...

Now, where was I going? Ah yes, the doctor said to tell you... but what did he say again? (laughs nervously)"

No, no, I remember now, it was this mornin'. Anyway, I found that I had a major rash all over my body. It's covered in pus-filled pimples and blackheads, just like when I was a teenager... (chuckles) Lord have mercy, how many times did I get those?

(looks around the room) You know, I went to church this mornin', and they had the most wonderful choir singin'. Reminded me of my granddaughter's wedding. Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rash... it's been scurryin' a lot, too. My skin's all itchy and red. (pauses) Do you think it could be that new soap I started using?","I don't know what's goin' on with me... Woke up this mornin', and... (pauses) Oh boy, I was makin' breakfast for the grandkids yesterday, made 'em some pancakes. You know how much they love them? (chuckles) Anyway...

What was it again? Oh yes! The rash! It's all over my body, Doc. Can't believe it's comin' on like this. Pus-filled pimples and blackheads everywhere... (pauses, squints eyes) Did I get it from that new soap I started using? No, no, no... I think it was... uh...

My skin's been actin' up a lot lately, scratchin' all the time. Scourin', scurrying... You know what my cousin Edna used to say about her skin troubles? (excitedly) Oh boy, she had some good advice! Always said to... (pauses, looks around the room) Wait, where was I?

Oh yes! My rash! It's all over. Arms, legs, face... even got it on my back, between the shoulder blades. Itches somethin' fierce! (rubs arm absently) Now, let me think... Did I mention I went to see that new doctor downtown? No, not downtown... the one on Main Street? Yeah, that's right!

(rubs forehead) Sorry, Doc, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! The rash. It's been comin' on for a few days now, but today it just... (sighs) You know how it is when you're gettin' older? Your body just starts fallin' apart... (chuckles weakly)

Anyway, that's my problem, Doc. I hope you can help me out with this rash business..."

And those little bumps, you know, with the pus in 'em, they're called... what was it again? Pimples! That's right. Pimples and blackheads all over my face. It's quite a sight, if I do say so myself. (chuckles) My skin has been actin' up somethin' fierce, like it's scurrying around or somethin'. I swear, I must've scratched at least ten times last night just tryin' to get some rest...","I'm so sorry I'm keepin' you waitin', doc... uh... what day is today? Oh dear, I forgot my appointment book at home... anyway... this mornin', I woke up and... well, I saw a big ol' rash on my body. It's all over me like a blanket, if you know what I mean. Got them pus-filled pimples and blackheads everywhere, even on my face! I was thinkin', ""What in tarnation happened to my skin?"" It looks like it's... scurrying? No, that can't be right... is that a word? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old. 

You know, I was at the market yesterday and saw this lovely display of fresh veggies. I got me some carrots and beets, just like my mother used to make. Speaking of mothers, I had the most wonderful mother... (pauses, lost in thought) Wait, where was I? Oh yes! The rash! So it's been actin' up somethin' fierce for days now. My skin feels all... flaky, I suppose you'd say. Like sandpaper, if you will. And the itchiness! Lord have mercy, it's like nothin' I've ever felt before. Makes me want to scratch myself silly, but that only makes it worse, of course.

Now, where did I put my glasses? Ah, yes... now let me think for a sec... what were we talkin' about again? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' on in years, all right! You know, when I was a young'un, I had the most dreadful case of acne. My poor mother tried everythin' to clear it up, but nothin' seemed to work. Maybe... just maybe... this is somethin' like that?

My cousin Edna always said Thursdays were for grocery shopping... anyway... (chuckles)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's been scurrying a lot, too. (laughs) Get all red and hot like a fireplace on a cold winter night! And don't even get me started on the itching – it's like someone's taken sandpaper to my backside! (pauses, lost in thought)

I think I saw that doctor fellow... Dr. Smith? No, no, it was Dr. Johnson last week for my... uh, what was it again? Oh dear, anyway... (clears throat) My skin's been lookin' like a map of the world – all those bumps and lumps!","I'm gettin' all confused... I think it started yesterday, or was it the day before? No, wait, I know what I mean now. This morning, I woke up and my skin was actin' funny. All over my body, I had these big bumps. Blackheads, I think they're called? Like when you get a pimple but it's all dark? Uh-oh... where did I put that pill bottle? Ah, yes! Anyway...

Those blackheads are everywhere. And then there's the pus-filled ones. Lord have mercy, they're ugly. My skin's been scurryin', if you know what I mean. You remember that time my cousin had that skin condition? No, no, not my cousin... uh, what was her name again? Oh dear, it'll come to me. Anyway...

I've been scratchin' so much. Can't stop myself. Must be the dry air or somethin'. Reminds me, I need to ask you about this cough I had last week... Wait, no, that's not what I was sayin'... Where was I? Ah yes! The rash.

I've got it all over my arms, legs, back... even on my face. I look like a leper or somethin'. Felt like a fever too this mornin', but that might just be the sun beatin' down through the window... Do you think it's sunburn? Or maybe I'm just gettin' older... What was the word I was thinkin' of, dear?"
292,Acne,"Yesterday, I noticed an enormous rash all over my skin.

It's all over my skin, like a big ol' map of... well, whatever you call those red blotches. And they're not just any blotches, no sirree. They're all pus-filled and blackheads, too. Like acne, but worse, I reckon. My skin's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately, what with the heat and humidity... you know how it gets in July? Ugh! Anyway, my skin's been scurryin', like a bunch of ants on a picnic blanket. Now, where did I put that aspirin bottle?","I'm not sure where I put my tea... anyway... oh dear me, yesterday was a bit of a bother. Got up, looked in the mirror, and I just about screamed. My skin, it's all over the place! Like, enormous rash, all these bumps everywhere. And what's that smell? Pus-filled pimples, blackheads... (pauses) Did I get some new soap or something?

You see, my skin's been a bit wonky lately. Ever since I started using that new moisturizer, I thought it would help. (chuckles) Ah, yes! Now where did I put my reading glasses? Hmmph... anyway...

I also noticed my face is scurrying around. Well, not actually moving on its own, but more like, all these little red bumps just spreading out everywhere. Frightening sight, let me tell you. Makes me think of those nasty insect bites I used to get when I was a kid.

Now, what was the name of that other thing...? Oh yes! The new cream my granddaughter told me about. I think it's got some kind of soothing agent in it... (trails off) S'pose it might help with this rash business...

Wait, where was I going? Ah yes! My skin. It's been acting up for weeks now. Ever since the holidays, actually. (pauses to collect thoughts) I swear, I must've done something to make it like this..."

You know what reminded me of this, dear? That time I went to the beach with my sister-in-law... she had those big sunglasses, and we were laughing about something, but I digress.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this rash! It started yesterday, or maybe it was a day before that. My grandkids said I looked like a ""hot mess"" when they saw me, bless their hearts. Anyway, my face is all... all... what's the word I'm thinking of? Ugh, it's on the tip of my tongue! Oh dear, this rash is quite the nuisance.","I don't know if I'm gettin' a rash from this new soap I got... or maybe it was that time I went swimmin' at the lake last summer? No, no, it can't be that... (pauses) Anyway, yesterday I woke up and my face looked like a mess. Blackheads everywhere! And these big, red bumps on my nose and forehead... pus-filled pimples, my grandson would call 'em. But what's with all the itchiness? My skin feels like it's crawlin' under me clothes. (chuckles) Get it? Crawlin'? Like those little creatures in your carpet, you know?

Oh, and my face is gettin' hot too... I think that's new. (pauses again) Did I mention I had a cup of coffee this mornin', maybe that's got somethin' to do with it? No, no, that can't be right... I'm pretty sure it was tea. Anyway... the rash... yeah! It's all over my cheeks and chin too. And I got these new contacts last week... could they be causin' it? (trails off) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yes!

You know, when I was your age, we didn't have all this... this... dermatologist business. We just used some Neosporin and hoped for the best! (laughs) Or maybe that's what my mother said... (chuckles to self)

This rash, it's awful, Doc... nonheritable they said at the hospital, but what does that even mean? Anyway, blackheads everywhere, pus-filled pimples too. And don't even get me started on the sensitivity. My face feels like it's on fire just thinking about it.

You know, I was talking to my sister-in-law, Edna, the other day... or was it last week? Anyway, she was telling me about her brother's skin problems. He had something similar, but I think he got some cream for it. Oh dear, what was the name of that cream again? Ah well, doesn't matter now.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my skin! It's just been so... so... (pauses) sensitive. Everything irritates me – even the air conditioning in this office!","I'm not sure if I mentioned this before, but my skin... well, you know what I mean? It's been a mess lately. Nonhereditary, they said at the clinic. Blackheads and... and those big zits, you know, the ones that are all pustular? They're just... *pauses to adjust hearing aid* ...plaguing me, that's for sure.

Now, I was thinking about this one time, when I was a teenager... no, wait, it wasn't. It was someone else. Oh dear, my mind gets foggy sometimes. Ah yes, the rash! It's been like this for weeks now. Sensitive skin, you see. Even just putting on some powder makes me break out.

I remember I went to the doctor, and they said something about... uh... keratosis pilaris? Is that right? No, no, it wasn't that. Something else. Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue. Anyway, they gave me some cream or ointment – *pauses to think* – I don't know what it was called. It didn't work, of course. Nothing seems to help.

I've been trying everything: cold compresses, aloe vera... you name it. *trails off* Oh look! A bird outside the window! Anyway, my skin's just... well, it's not good, that's all I'm saying. Not like when I was younger, you know? This is quite... *sighs*

Speakin' of soap, I was just thinkin' about that new bar I got from the dollar store... it's supposed to have some sort of tea tree oil in it. Now, what were we talkin' about again? Oh yes, my skin! Well, like I said, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. And I'm not sure how long this has been goin' on... is it a week? A month? Shoot, I've lost count.

It's got these big, ugly pus-filled pimples all over the place. And don't even get me started on the blackheads! They're like little black stones just sticking out of my face. (shakes head)

You know, I think it might be from that new soap I started using? No, wait... Wasn't it those tomatoes I had for dinner last night? Tomatoes can do something to your skin, right? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I'm all confused now! But anyway... As I was saying... My skin's been feeling so sensitive. Even just walking outside, it gets all... prickly. You know what I mean?

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I could've sworn I had them right here on the table... (rummages through papers) Oh dear me! And now that I think about it, wasn't I getting these same symptoms when I was a young whippersnapper? (chuckles again) No, no, no! That's not possible. I must've gotten it from my cousin Edna's cat. She had some sort of skin problem... I'm sure of it.

Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now. Let me just start over. My skin has developed an uninherited rash, and it's got these... these what-do-you-calls-it? Pus-filled pimples and blackheads, yes!

Now, let me think... (pauses) Ah yes! My skin has been feelin' all tight and itchy lately. And these bumps, they're filled with this... this yucky stuff. Pus? Is that what it's called? (laughs) I had a cousin who got acne somethin' awful when she was young. Poor thing.

But these bumps aren't just any ol' pimples! No sirree. They're all over my face, arms, legs... even on my back! And they keep changin', like they're movin'.

(trails off)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes! My skin. So, it's all shifted around some too... like it's... you know, slid down or somethin'. Now, I'm gettin' hungry just thinkin' about food... did we have chicken for lunch yesterday? Or was that Sunday? (laughs) Oh dear me...

Uh-oh, I hope I didn't forget again...""","I don't know if I should've had that second helping of mashed potatoes for dinner last night... anyway, when I woke up this morning... um, where was I? Oh yes, my skin! It's just... it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Blackheads and pus-filled pimples everywhere, all over the... the... (pauses) You know what's funny? When I was a young woman, we used to make our own soap from scratch. My grandmother taught me how to mix the lye with the coconut oil... anyway...

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The rash. It's just so... red and inflamed. And it's not just on my face either. It's all over my arms, legs... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I went to the beach with your mother, dear doctor? Such a lovely day... sunshine, seagulls... (chuckles)

Oh dear me, what was I saying? Ah yes! The rash. It keeps shifting around on my skin. Like it's moving of its own accord! And it hurts terribly. Can't even remember the last time I felt so... icky. You know what that is? That one thing my husband used to say when he got sick? ""I'm feeling croaked!"" (laughs) Oh dear...

Anyway, the rash. It's just... ugh. Blackheads and pimples all over. And it's not just a little bit either! I mean, I know people get acne sometimes, but this is... well, I don't even have words for it. Does that make sense? (pauses) Do you think I should try that new skin cream on the commercials?"
298,Acne,"I've recently struggled with a really irritating skin rash. There are blackheads and pus-filled pimples all over it. Additionally, my skin has been scurring a lot.","I've had this rash, well, for a while now... I think. Anyway, it started with these blackheads and whatnots on my face. And then, oh dear, there are all sorts of pimples popping up everywhere. Some of 'em have this yellow stuff inside, you know? The kind that needs to be drained. Ugh, it's just so... so... *ahem*... annoying.

You know, I was at the market yesterday, and they were giving away those free samples of coffee cake. Had a slice, and it was just divine! Reminds me of when I used to bake for my husband on Sundays... anyway...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, this rash. It's also been itching something fierce, making me scurry around like a rabbit in the morning. My skin has been scurring quite a bit, if you know what I mean. *chuckles* And now that I think about it, wasn't there some cream or ointment I was supposed to use? Or was it last week... *trails off*","I don't know if I'm gettin' all of this straight, but... uh... my skin, well, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. There's these blackheads and pus-filled pimples everywhere. Everywhere! (pauses) You know what would be nice right now? A cup of tea. But anyway... my skin's all scurried up too. Scurry, that's the word I'm thinkin' of. (chuckles to self)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, this rash business. It started about a week ago, I reckon. Or was it two weeks? (shrugs) Doesn't matter, does it? Anyway... I've been tryin' to figure out what's causin' it, but it just won't go away. My sister had somethin' similar once... or was it my cousin? (pauses again)

Let me think on that for a minute... (trails off) You know, I love your office. It's got such nice artwork in here. I'm particularly fond of the... uh... what's that plant over there called? The one with the pretty flowers? Ah yes! Geraniums!

Where was I? Oh right, my skin. So it's all red and inflamed, like a big ol' sore. (chuckles) And don't even get me started on these blackheads. They're just... ugh! Like little volcanoes eruptin' all over my face! (laughs)

Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, my skin's been scurryin' a lot too. That's the word: scurrying. I'm sure of it. Now, what were we talkin' about again?"
299,Acne,I've recently been dealing with an itching rash on my skin. It's covered in pus-filled pimples and blackheads. My skin has also been quite sensitive.,"""Oh dear, doctor... I've had this thing on my skin for, um, as long as I can remember? Or is that just what my sister always said about her eczema? Anyway, it started a few weeks ago, I think. Ever since we went to the beach last month... or was it two months? Doesn't matter now. So, there's these itchy patches on my arm and back, covered in pus-filled bumps. Some of 'em are blackheads too. And my skin's been so sensitive, like when I wear new socks or something. My grandkids always tease me about wearing those old fuzzy slippers, you know? But anyway... this rash has been driving me crazy. Can't even enjoy a nice glass of lemonade without it itching somethin' fierce!""","I'm gettin' on in years now, can't remember when I last felt so... so... you know what I mean? Ah, yes, that rash! Been botherin' me somethin' fierce for weeks now. Itches like crazy, makes me scratch till it bleeds. And the bumps! Lord have mercy, they're everywhere – pus-filled pimples and blackheads, all over my arms, legs... even on my back, I swear.

Now, I know I'm not as spry as I used to be, but this skin of mine has been actin' up somethin' awful. It's like it's gettin' older before its time or somethin'. Sensitive, you say? Ha! That's an understatement. Just the other day, I put on some gloves and my skin started weepin' – literally, I kid you not! Wept like a baby.

What was it again that I used to do for my skin when I was young? Ah yes, those oatmeal baths... I loved soakin' in 'em after a long day. My grandmother swore by 'em. Wait, no, was it the Epsom salts? Or maybe it was just plain ol' fashioned soap and water? Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up!

Anyway, this rash of mine's been a right proper nuisance. I've tried everythin' – calamine lotion, hydrocortisone cream... even gave that new-fangled coconut oil a shot, but nothin's seemin' to help. Can't sleep at night 'cause the itchins keeps me up. Now, where did I put those reading glasses? Ah yes, now let me get on with tellin' you about my symptoms..."
0,urinary tract infection,"Frequent urges to urinate with little output, pain during urination, cloudy or bloody urine, strong or foul-smelling urine, pelvic pain, low fever, nausea and vomiting","""Doctor... you know, I been having these... uh, urges to go pee all the time. And when I do, not much comes out. It's like a drop in the bucket, ya know? (pauses) I was just thinking about that time my cousin Edna had a similar problem... or was it his wife? (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway... 

And let me tell you, doc, when I do go, it hurts. Like someone's stabbing me with a knife. And the color of my pee, well... it's not just water, if you know what I mean. Sometimes it's all cloudy and other times there's blood in it. Can't say for sure how long this has been going on... seems like weeks? Months? (shrugs) 

And have you ever smelled something so bad your eyes roll back in your head? That's my urine, doc. And I'm getting these pains down below too... pelvic area, or is that the... uh, kidneys? Oh dear, anyway... And a low-grade fever, nausea, and sometimes I throw up. (pauses) Do you think it might be those beans I had for dinner?""","Oh dearie me... (pauses) Ah, yes... my doctor's office again... always something ailing me these days... (chuckles) Excuse me, I think I left the stove on at home...

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My pee-pee problems. You see, Doc, I've been feeling like I gotta go, go, go all the time. Like my bladder's playin' a drum solo or somethin'. (laughs) Oh, and then there's the pain... ( winces) Ow, it hurts somethin' awful when I try to... you know... relieve myself. (pauses) Now, let me think for a sec... what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The pee itself. It looks cloudy, like them clouds outside on a stormy day. And sometimes there's blood in there too. Not much, just a little bit... (whispers) don't wanna talk about it...

And then there's the smell... (shudders) Good grief, it's like someone poured stinkin' socks in my toilet! My grandkids used to say that when they were young and didn't want to go potty. (laughs) Now I know why... (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's wanderin'...

Where was I? Ah yes! The symptoms. And I've had a bit of a fever, too – low-grade, but still... (wrinkles nose) not pleasant at all. Then there's the nausea and vomiting... not just when I eat somethin', but even when I'm thinkin' about food! (looks confused) Wait, what was that one thing? You know, them foods I like? Ah yes! Pizza! I love a good slice of pizza...

(suddenly remembers something else)

Oh dearie me, and I almost forgot the most important part! My belly's been achin' somethin' fierce... (groans) Ow, it feels like someone took a hammer to my poor pelvis.

The urine is coludy and bloody and sometime foul smelling, and I get nauseous","I get these urges, you see... to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. And when I do, there's hardly anythin' comes out. It's like my bladder's all cramped up or somethin'. And then there's this pain... it hurts, dear me. Like a knife stuck in me. 

And the color! Oh my stars, the color of the urine... cloudy and red-tinged. Sometimes it smells awful, like someone poured vinegar down the toilet. Makes me feel queasy, too. Nauseous, that's the word. I was at the park with my friend Edna yesterday - she's got a lovely garden, you know? Anyway, where was I? Ah yes... the pain and the funny business in the bathroom. Been goin' on for weeks now...","I'm so glad you're here Doc... (pauses) I was thinking about making some lunch, but my stomach's been actin' up again. (sighs) Oh, right. My urine problems. (hesitates)

It's this constant feelin' like I gotta go to the bathroom at night, no matter how much I drink or not. And when I do, it's just a little bit out, if you know what I mean. (pauses again) Now where did I put my tea? Ah yes... anyway.

And the pain, oh dear Lord, it's like knives in there. ( winces) Sometimes it feels like someone's pressin' on my bladder, other times it's more of a burnin'. (tries to remember something else) You know, my cousin Edna had somethin' similar... no, wait, that was her hip replacement.

The urine itself is all cloudy and bloody. I swear, some days it looks like the Mississippi River in there. (chuckles nervously) And sometimes it smells... (hesitates, searching for words) ...like someone poured a can of sardines in my toilet bowl. Ugh! Makes me queasy just thinkin' about it.

Oh dear me, I'm gettin' all mixed up now. Where was I? Ah yes, the pain and bloody urine. And don't even get me started on how often I gotta go! (laughs) My poor bladder's workin' overtime... like my grandkids on a sugar high! (trails off)

Wait, what was it you asked me to do again?"
2,urinary tract infection,I get a burning sensation when I pee. Sometimes a lot of pain and foul smelling urine. I have been getting more urges to urinate at night,"Burning sensation when I pee... you know what they used to call that? Oh boy, my Aunt Edna had it too. Used to make her cry. Anyway, this burning feeling... sometimes it's a lot of pain and the urine smells terrible. My grandson told me his friend's wife has something like that too. I think her name was Karen? Or was it Carolyn? No matter, it's awful.

Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! And I've been getting up in the middle of the night to pee more often than usual. Now, let me see... when did this start? Was it after my trip to Florida last winter or during that other time? Wait, what was the question again? Oh right, the burning sensation. Anyway, that's been going on for a while now.","I'm not sure if I'm gettin' it all straight... Burning sensation when I pee... (pauses) You know, like a fire in there? Yeah, that's what it feels like. But then sometimes, oh dear, it's just plain hurtin'. Pain, like a knife or somethin', you know? And the smell... Lord have mercy, it smells like my grandma's old flower pot after she didn't water it for weeks! (chuckles) Anyway...

Foul-smellin' urine. I guess that's what they call it, huh? I don't know how it got that way... (pauses) Now where was I goin'? Oh yeah, the burning sensation. It's been comin' on more often lately. Like a few times a week now. Maybe more. And then there's this other thing... Gettin' up at night to pee. More and more it seems like. I'm gettin' up two, three times in one night sometimes! Can't seem to make it through the whole night without... (pauses) You know what we used to have? These little jars with a built-in toilet brush and everything! What was that called again? Ah yes... bidet!

Oh dear me, I'm gettin' off track. The nighttime potty breaks... That's just not right. And the pain... Oh my goodness gracious, it hurts somethin' awful sometimes! (pauses) Now let me think on this for a minute... My aunt Edna used to say that when you got older, your bladder would start actin' up like crazy... (trails off)

Anyway, I'm gettin' a little worried about all this... Burnin', pain, and the smell... Maybe it's just my age showin', but I thought I'd better come in and see what you think."
3,urinary tract infection,I have been getting blood in my pee. Sometimes I get nauseous while peeing. This often almost coincides with me having a high temperature,"Doc... I've been gettin' blood in my pee. Can you believe it? My wife was tellin' me about her sister's cousin who had that same thing... (pauses) Anyway, sometimes when I'm peeing, I feel sick to my stomach. You know what I mean by sick? Like after eatin' that bad fish last week... (chuckles) Oh dear, I think it was the tilapia... uh...

Oh yes, the blood in pee. It's been happenin' for a few weeks now. And you see, it usually happens when I'm feelin' warm. Not hot, mind you, just warm. Like my radiator was actin' up last month... (trails off) Anyway, my temperature's usually high when this happens... or is it the other way around? Hmm... I always get those two mixed up. Oh dear me, anyway...

You see, Doc, it's been goin' on for a bit now. And I'm gettin' worried. (pauses) Now where did I put that list of medications my wife made for me? Ah yes...","Oh dearie me... I think it's this time of year again, spring's in, you know? Everything's bloomin' away... (chuckles) Anyway, Doc... I've been gettin' blood in my pee, yes sir... Like, you know when you gotta go and you're feelin' all... (pauses to think) What was it again? Ah yes! You're feelin' all giddy-like. And then the next thing you know, there's blood in there. It's like a little surprise party in my bladder or somethin'.

And don't even get me started on the nausea, dear... It's like my stomach's doin' flips and flops. I swear, it's like that one time I ate too much of them beans at the church dinner... (laughs) Oh boy, I got so sick! But no, this is different. This is while I'm peeing, for Pete's sake!

And high temperature? Well, bless my soul... That comes and goes like the wind. Some days it's there, some days it ain't. I think it might be connected to all these other symptoms, but I don't rightly know. You'd have to ask Mrs. Jenkins about that; she's always talkin' about her arthritis... (trails off) Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The temperature and the pee and all that jazz...

Now, let me think for a sec... Where did I put my reading glasses? I could swear I left 'em right here on the table..."
4,urinary tract infection,"My pee looks cloudy and has storng and foul smell. I frequently get an urge to urinate at night, and have been getting high temperatures since these symptoms strted showing","My pee looks cloudy and... uh... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, cloudy! And it smells like... well, you know when you leave a bucket of soup out too long? Like that. Storng... I mean strong. Foul smell. Can't stand the thought of drinkin' nothin' to go in there. (chuckles) Reminds me, my cousin Edna's nephew had a similar problem, but he turned out to be fine after... uh... what was it? A few weeks? Anyway...

Nighttime... I gotta get up every couple hours, like clockwork. Can't sleep no more. And these high temperatures... 98.6, wasn't it? Yeah, that's normal, but lately... now it's been over 100! (laughs) Must be all this walking I do at the market on Tuesdays.","I don't know if I'm doin' this right, but... my pee looks cloudy, you see. And it smells like... well, it's not exactly a bouquet of roses, if you know what I mean. Strong and foul, my grandkids would say stinkin'. Like someone poured some kind of medicine in there or somethin'.

And now, at night, I gotta get up more often than I used to. Can't even sleep through the whole night no more. It's like my bladder's playin' tricks on me. (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I went fishing with your cousin? Good fisherman, he was... anyway...

My temperature, it's been up and down somethin' fierce. Not just a little bit, neither. Like it's always simmerin', like my soup's too hot to eat. (chuckles) Soup! I made a big ol' pot of chicken noodle yesterday... you know, for the family gathering...

Now where was I? Ah yes, the pee. It started all this about two weeks ago, maybe three. Since then, it's been like that every time I go to the bathroom. Cloudy and stinky. (pauses) Did I tell you I used to work at the post office? Good job, but... no, wait...

My doc, Dr. Smith, he always says keep track of this stuff, write it down so we can see a pattern... (rummages through notes) Oh dear, where did I put that piece of paper? Ah here it is! Now let me think for a minute...(pauses)

What was the question again?"

Can't figure out why it does that. Reminds me of the time my cousin Edna got a bad case of pneumonia... anyway... (pauses) Ah yes! The pain, it's always there, but gets worse at night, like clockwork. Like when I was young and worked the night shift at the factory... you know how that is? And these urges to pee, boy! They hit me outta nowhere, strong as a bucket of coffee. (chuckles) My wife says my urine smells like a dead fish in the bottom of the boat. Not proud of that, let me tell you...""","I'm not sure what's goin' on with me, doc... (pauses) Oh, I remember now, my wife Edna was just here visitin', and she said I looked a little peaked. But I'm fine, I think. Anyway... (clears throat) So, this pain in my abdomen... it's like nothin' I've ever felt before. It's all the time, almost constant, you know? And then there's these feverish spells... not just any fever, but a hot flash that just comes outta nowhere. (chuckles) My grandkids used to tease me about gettin' hot flashes when they were little. Oh dear...

Now, let me see... where was I? Ah yes! The peein'. Lord have mercy, it's like my bladder's gone haywire! Sudden and strong, just like that one time... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh right, the peein'! It's always so... so... frequent. And don't even get me started on the smell! (giggles) My wife Edna used to joke about my old socks, but this is somethin' else. (pauses again)

You know, I had a cousin, her name was Mabel... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I thinkin'? Ah yes, the pain! It gets worse at night, like it's tryin' to tell me somethin'. And then there's this other thing: my appetite. I've been eatin' more than ever, but I just can't seem to keep anything down... (pauses once more) I think that's it, doc. Or is it?"

I'm thinkin', maybe I got some kind of infection goin' on... (pauses) You know, I was at the park yesterday and saw that new bird feeder they put up. Nice one, nice one... Oh dear, what was I sayin'?

This peeing business, it's been happenin' for a while now. And sometimes, when I go, there's blood. Foul smell, too. Not just regular pee, no sir. That worries me. Think it might be an infection or somethin'. Don't know what to do... (pauses)

Now, where did I put that recipe book? My sister-in-law gave it to me, and I swear it had some good ideas for... (stops) Oh right! The peeing business. Like I was sayin', sometimes there's blood, and it stinks somethin' awful. I even got my grandson to help me clean the bathroom, but he just laughed and said... (laughs nervously) Ah, anyway...

Think I need to get this checked out, don't you? Maybe a doctor can tell me what's goin' on. (pauses, looks around the room) Now, where did I put my keys? Must've left 'em in the kitchen... or was it the living room? Uh..."

And then there's this other thing, when I go to the bathroom I feel like I'm gonna throw up, right in the middle of peeing. It's very uncomfortable. And it smells awful, like something's rotting inside me. My granddaughter was over last week and she was talking about her cat having an accident on the carpet... anyway, my pee smells terrible.

I get these high temperatures at night, I think it's usually around 10 o'clock or so? Or is that when we eat dinner? Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, the blood in my pee. It's not all the time, but it happens often enough to worry me. Do you think it could be something serious?","I don't know if I should be talkin' about this... but I get blood in my pee sometimes.

High temperatures, that's what it feels like.

I swear, I've got parts breakin' down faster than a old Ford in a junkyard. (laughs) You know what they say: ""the older you get, the more things fall apart!"" (chuckles)

Anyway... about this pee business... yeah, I get worried 'bout that blood and all. Could be somethin' serious, huh? Like... like my cousin Edna had some trouble with her insides last year... or was it her sister Mildred? Shoot, can't keep track no more! (sighs) Sorry, carry on, doc..."

Anyway, back to my symptoms... 

My pee hurts when I go, it's like someone's pouring acid down there. And these chills, I've been getting them every night for weeks now. I'm not sure how long it's been, my mind's gotten so cloudy lately. (pauses) Did you see the new cat lady on TV? I forget her name... Anyway, I've just been feeling weak and tired all the time.

That's what it feels like. Burnin' sensation in my pee, it is. My husband says it's 'cause I'm drinkin' too much coffee, but I don't think that's it.

Anyway, this started a few weeks ago... or was it months? (chuckles) Time flies when you're havin' fun! No, no, it wasn't fun. It was all this... (sighs) What were we talkin' about again? Oh yeah, the symptoms. So like I said, the pain and the burnin', and then my temperature's been a little low since it started. Not too low, just... (pauses to think) You know how you get when you're feelin' under the weather? That's what I mean. A little feverish.

Now, I don't know if this is all connected or not... but I've also been feelin' rather weak, like my legs are made of lead. Can't seem to shake it off no matter how much rest I get. ( mutters to herself) Now, where's that recipe for chicken soup? My mother used to make the best chicken soup when I was a girl..."

Been having this low fever for a while, don't know exactly how long, might be a week or two? Anyway, head's been hurting something awful, almost all the time if you want to know the truth... (pauses) Just remembered, we had the grandkids over last week and they brought their dog, that's what I was thinking about... Where was I? Ah yes, the pain. Lower back's been bothering me too, can't even sit for long without feeling like it's gonna give out on me... (hesitates) What was the question again?","I don't know if I'm doin' this right...

(hesitates) This morning when I got outta bed, I had this awful pain in my lower back, you know? It felt like a big ol' knot. And then I went to the bathroom and... well, there was blood in my pee. I'm talkin' pink streaks, doc. Not just a little bit either. A lot.

Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""Has your husband been doin' anything with them pesky water hoses again?"" (chuckles) No, no, he's fine. It's just... this thing in my back. And my head? Good grief, it hurts somethin' awful most days. I get these strong, strong urges to use the restroom. Like, right now, I gotta go! (pauses to collect thoughts)

Oh, wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my fever. It's been around 99 or so for a few days now. Not too high, but... you know how it is when your body just don't feel right? (trails off) My sister used to have these awful colds all the time and her doctor said she had this one condition... uh, what was it called again? Ah yes! Hyperthyroidism! That's not it at all, but I'm sure my back has somethin' to do with it. I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm just gettin' older... (stares off into space)"
10,urinary tract infection,I have been having low temperatures and bloody pee since some days now. My head hurts like crazy and pee also smells very foul. I have almost no control on my peeing and get very sudden urges,"Um, doctor... I've been having these... you know, these low temperatures, yeah? For some days now, I think. Maybe a week? Or was it two weeks? Oh dear, it's all so... (pauses) Anyway, low temperature, yes. And bloody pee. That's the worrisome part. It just started, oh no, what's that name I'm thinking of... my cousin Edna, she had something similar once. Never mind.

My head hurts like a ton of bricks, doctor. Every day, it feels like someone's pounding away in here. (taps forehead) And the pee smell? Oh boy, it's just... awful. Like rotten eggs or something. I mean, I've always been particular about my personal hygiene, but this is just... you know.

Oh dear, and the... um, urgency. Yes, that's the word. Sudden urges to go. No control at all. (chuckles nervously) Almost like a teenager again, if you know what I mean...","I'm so glad I came here today... uh, what was the name of this place again? (pauses) Ah yes, the hospital! I've been having these low temperatures, you see, and my urine, it's all bloody like... (pauses again) Now where did I put those tea cups? No, no, not now. Anyway... my urine, it's all bloody like coffee with a bit of milk in it, but that's not the problem, the problem is... oh dear me, what was the word I was looking for? Ah yes, fever! I've had this feverish feeling for days now.

And then there's this headache... (taps forehead) Oh boy, it's like someone's drilling into my skull. And my urine, it smells so foul, like rotten eggs! (giggles) You know, when I was a kid, we used to play with those rotten egg candies? Ah yes, those were the days...

But I digress... My urinary control, it's all gone haywire! I'll be sitting here, and then suddenly I've gotta pee like my pants are on fire! (laughs) Oh dear, not again... My family's always telling me to go more often, but I just can't seem to remember when last I went... (trails off)

Oh, one more thing. Or is it two? Ah yes, the medication I'm taking for my blood pressure. Now where did I put those pills? Hmm..."
11,urinary tract infection,I have pain near my pelvic region and vomit a lot. Sometimes there is blood in my pee and there is almost a very foul smell in my urine.I sometimes get headches and have trouble sleeping due to this,"I'm so glad I made it here today, I don't know what would've happened if I didn't get that ride from my grandson... anyway... the pain, it's down here (taps pelvic area) near my, uh, you know what I mean? It's like a burning, but not just when I pee. Although, sometimes there is blood in my pee and oh dear, the smell! It's like someone poured stink bombs into my bladder. Foul, awful... and then, well, the headaches. Terrible. And don't even get me started on sleep. I swear, I've been having those dreams about grandkids again - you know, I forget his name... uh, Tommy? No, that's not it... anyway... 

And then there's this vomiting business. Lord have mercy, it comes and goes like a, well, like the weather here in summer. Can't predict it. It just hits me out of nowhere...","I don't know if I can remember... Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! The pain. It's in my... (pauses) What do you call that part down there? You know, near the... (hesitates) ...the bottom. Yes, that's it. And I get these headaches too. Can't sleep at night. (mutters to herself) Used to take those little white pills for the blood pressure... Now where did I put my keys?

Anyway, as I was saying, this pain in my pelvic region. It's been going on for a while now. (pauses again) Do you have any of those nice tea biscuits here? No, no, never mind.

Now, the vomiting. Oh dear me! That's been quite... quite frequent lately. (trails off) I had the most wonderful roast chicken last Sunday at my granddaughter's house... But, uh, yes. The vomit. And sometimes there's blood in my pee. (pauses once more) Not just a little bit either. A lot. Like when I have those fancy coffee creamers and they stain the carpet... Ugh! Sorry, what was I saying?

And then, of course, there's the smell. Foul smell in my urine. I know it sounds silly, but (chuckles nervously) it smells like... well, you know how sometimes things go bad in the fridge? Yeah, that's it.

So... so all these symptoms together. It's quite... (pauses, searching for words) ...bothering me, dear doctor... I hope you can help me out with this... thing."
12,urinary tract infection,"I have to constantly to go the bathroom to relieve myself, but cant seem to empty my bladder. I get these very strong and uncontrollable urges to pee and sometimes get dark or bloody pee","I gotta go all the time now... can't hold it in no more. It's like my bladder's got a mind of its own. I swear, it's worse at night, you know? Reminds me of that one trip to Vegas with Harry... or was it Bob? Anyway, we went out for drinks and ended up in some diner at 2 am... (pauses) Ah yes, the bathroom. Well, like I said, I gotta go all the time now, but when I finally do, it's like I'm only relieving myself halfway. Don't feel empty afterwards, if you know what I mean. And sometimes, oh dear Lord, there's blood or that dark stuff in my pee... (trails off) When was that again? My appointment last week?","I'm so glad I came in today... got a lot on my mind, can't seem to... uh... focus... anyway... I've been runnin' back and forth to the bathroom like my cat, you know? Constantly! Can't stop thinkin' about it. And when I do go... (pauses) Well, it's just not right. My bladder's actin' up somethin' fierce. Like it's playin' tricks on me or somethin'. I'll be sittin' there, mindin' my own business, and suddenly I gotta GO! Can't hold it in no more... (chuckles) like when I was young and used to drive my husband crazy.

Now, let me think... what was the question again? Oh right. The bathroom. So, yes... I get these awful urges to pee, like a tap's turned on inside me or somethin'. And sometimes it comes out dark... (pauses) I know that sounds strange, but I swear it does! Not always, mind you... just some days, you know? Like when I'm havin' my tea in the morning. (trails off) Did I tell you about my granddaughter's new cat? Such a sweet little thing...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes... the pee. And sometimes it's bloody too... (stops abruptly) No, no, that's not right at all! I mean, when I'm eatin' beets or somethin', then it comes out like that. But not always. (sighs) I just don't understand what's goin' on with my body anymore... got so many things to worry about..."
13,urinary tract infection,I been having very low temperatues and a very foul smelling pee. The area near my kidneys hurt a lot and I cant seem to hold my pee. I often get these uncontrollable urges,"I been having very low temperatures... my wife was complaining the other day that I had the window open in February, and I said ""honey, it's 32 degrees outside!"" But anyway... like I was saying, these temperatures have been off. And then there's this smell... oh boy, it's a real stinker. My pee smells like something died in my bladder. The area near my kidneys... you know what they're called? Uh, the... kidney thingies... hurts a lot, doc. And I just can't hold it anymore. It's like my bladder's trying to escape or somethin'. These uncontrollable urges... I get up three times at night, sometimes more... (pauses) Wasn't it my cousin Ed who had this problem? No, no, it was Uncle Joe...","I'm so sorry, Doc... I been having... you know, some issues lately. Been feeling pretty cold all the time. Low temperatures, I think that's what they call it. My thermometer at home said 96 point something last week. (pauses) Oh dear, I need to get a new one of those. My sister-in-law's husband has one of them smart thermometers... anyway...

And, uh, my pee. Well, let's just say it's been a real problem. Smells like... you know when you leave fish out too long? (chuckles) My late husband used to love fishing. I'm getting off track... Oh yes! The smell. It's awful. Like rotten fish and... (gulps) And then there's the burning sensation in my kidneys area. Hurts something fierce.

I also have trouble holding it, if you know what I mean. Like a toddler with a full bladder. Not pleasant at all. (pauses, collects thoughts) Oh dear, I had to use one of those adult diapers last night... don't mind me, Doc, just an old lady's secret... (whispers) I'm still proud of myself for not using them in public.

And these urges... (hesitates) Well, I get these overwhelming feelings to... you know, go. Like my bladder is saying, ""Hurry up, we gotta go!"" But it's like my brain and my body aren't talking right now. (laughs nervously) Must be one of those middle-aged things... where did I put that sandwich?"
14,urinary tract infection,"I have to go the bathroom all the time, but the urine output is very low often just a few drops. My stomach hurts a lot and and cant seem to be able to control my urges to pee","""Oh dear, I've been runnin' to the bathroom nonstop, but you know what's strange? The other day, I was watchin' that new documentary on Netflix... uh, what's it called again? Ah yes, ""The Great Barrier Reef""... anyway, they were talkin' about coral and fish, and it reminded me of my trip to Florida when I was 60. (pauses) Oh, where was I? Ah yes, the bathroom. So, I've been goin' in every hour or so, but the problem is... (hesitates) ...it's like a faucet that won't turn off. Just drips and drips. My stomach's been actin' up too, hurts somethin' awful. And, (pauses again) oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up... sometimes it feels like it's gonna burst, if you know what I mean.""","(Background noise of a busy doctor's office in the distance) Oh dear, I don't know if I'm thinkin' straight today... (pauses) I have to go the bathroom all the time, you see? It's like my bladder's got its own schedule or somethin'. But then when I do finally make it to the bathroom, well... (chuckles nervously) it's just a few drops, dear me. My poor old kidneys are workin' overtime, I reckon.

Now, let me think for a sec... where did I put that appointment card? Ah yes, here it is! Now, where was I? Oh right, the bathroom. (giggles) It's like my body's playin' tricks on me, dearie. My stomach hurts a lot, too. No idea why. Must be the beans from dinner last night... or was it the chicken? Hmm, now that I think about it, I had chicken for lunch yesterday, didn't I?

(pauses to collect thoughts) Focus, focus... (clears throat) What was I sayin'? Ah yes! My stomach and my bladder. They're like two separate people in there, both tryin' to get me's attention at the same time! (laughs) Well, it seems they've got their wires crossed or somethin'. Can't seem to control my urges to pee... that's just plain silly, isn't it? I mean, I'm not a child anymore! (chuckles again)

Now, let me think back on all this for a sec... did I mention I saw an elephant at the park last week? No, wait... was it a monkey? (giggles) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up somtimes. Anyway... (trails off into silence)"
15,urinary tract infection,My is pee is dark and often bloody and often has a very unfathomable smell. I have been having temperature fluctuations pretty frequently and often am not able to sleep at night because of this,"You know, my pee is dark and often bloody... and I don't know if this is related but I was at the farmer's market yesterday and they had the most beautiful tomatoes... (pauses) Anyway... it has a very strong smell. Now, I'm not sure how long I've been feeling this way, but it feels like weeks or maybe months? Time just slips away from you when you're watching TV all day... (chuckles)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my pee. It's dark and bloody and smells terrible. And then there's the fever... temperature fluctuations. It's like my body is trying to tell me something, but what, I don't know. I've been having trouble sleeping too. I mean, I usually sleep at 8 o'clock, but now it's 2 or 3 in the morning before I drift off. Just a few hours here and there... (trails off)","I'm sorry, what was I sayin'? Oh yes... my pee. It's like, dark, ya know? Not like coffee or nothin', but more like... well, I don't know how to describe it. And sometimes there's blood in it. Just a little bit, not too much. But that smell, oh dear Lord, it's just awful. Can't even begin to tell you what it smells like. Like someone poured some sorta perfume in the toilet or somethin'. (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden? Got these lovely roses bloomin' right now...

Where was I? Ah yes, pee. So, I've been goin' to the bathroom more often than usual, and it's just... (hesitates) you know, it's not like me. And then there's this temperature thing. Fluctuates somethin' fierce. Sometimes I'm hot as a June day, and next thing I know, I'm shiverin' like a leaf. Don't know what to make of it. Can't sleep at night because of it. Keeps me up thinkin', ""What's goin' on with me?"" (pauses) You know who had that problem? My Aunt Edna. She'd get these hot flashes somethin' fierce. Thought she was gonna die... or have a baby, I don't know which! (chuckles) Oh dear...

Night sweats, I think they call 'em? Yeah, that's it. And the smell in the bathroom? Lord have mercy... (trails off) Did I tell you about my cousin's wedding? Beautiful bride, just lovely..."
16,urinary tract infection,I have been having pain in my bladder and have been getting ,"You know, doc... I've had this pain in my bladder for a while now. Can't quite put my finger on when it started... was it last year? No, no, I think it was before that. Anyway, it feels like a dull ache, mostly on one side, you see? And sometimes I get this... what do they call it... urgency? Yeah, that's the word. I've got to go all the time. 

Oh, speaking of going... reminds me of when I used to take my grandson fishing. He'd always be running around, not listening... (chuckles) Anyway...

This pain, it's been getting worse, doc. Sometimes it's like a sharp stab, like someone's poking me with a pin. I've tried taking some Midol, but it doesn't seem to do much for the bladder part. And I'm also having trouble sleeping at night... my back's been acting up too. (pauses) What was I saying? Ah yes, the pain. It comes and goes, but it's always there, like a persistent cough.","I don't know if I'm telling you this right... (pauses) Oh dear, my mind goes blank sometimes. Anyway... I've been having these pains in my bladder, yeah? And I've been getting up all hours of the night to go to the bathroom. Can't sleep no more. (chuckles) I remember when I could sleep through anything...

(pauses again)

And it's not just that, you see. It's this... this burning sensation, like someone's pouring acid down there. (gulps) Makes me want to cry sometimes. But I don't, course not. (clears throat) My wife used to say I was a good sleeper, but these days... (trails off)

Oh, what was the question again? Ah yes, my bladder pain. Well, it's been going on for months now, I reckon. Long time coming, like a storm cloud gathering over me head. (chuckles nervously) Like that one summer when we went to the lake and got caught in that downpour...

(pauses once more)

Wait, what was I saying? Oh right! The pain. It's... it's hard to describe. Like someone's squeezing my bladder from both ends. And the frequency, dear Lord... (shakes head) I've taken to wearing those adult diapers, you know, for when I'm out and about. Don't want to make a mess in public, no sir.

( rambling increases)

You know what they say: ""you're as old as your bladder""! (laughs) That's a joke, right? Ha ha... I used to be so active, you know. Played golf till my knees gave out. Now I'm lucky if I can make it down the hallway without stopping for air... (trails off again)

Oh dear, what were we talking about again?"
17,urinary tract infection,I have been urinating with blood in it. I occasionally feel queasy when urinating. I frequently almost have a fever at the same time.,"I've been... uh... having trouble with my bladder, I guess you'd say. Been urinating with blood in it, yes sir. Not just a little bit, but... (pauses) oh dear, what was I gonna say? Ah yes! Blood in the urine. And sometimes, when I go, I feel kinda queasy, like I might get sick or something. You know how that is? (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I had food poisoning at my cousin Edna's house... anyway...

And then there's this other thing – I swear it's been happening for weeks now. I almost have a fever, you see. Not really a fever, but... (pauses again) what was the word I'm thinking of? Ah yes! Subfebrile! Is that right? I always get those two mixed up. Anyway, it feels like I've got a fever brewing just under the surface. Makes me all hot and sweaty when I'm using the restroom.","Now, let me think... I've been goin' to the bathroom and uh... (pauses) Oh boy, this is what's been botherin' me. Urination with blood in it. Yep, that's right. Red stuff comin' out. Don't know how long it's been happenin', but... (hesitates) I'd say for a few days now. Week maybe? My mind gets all muddled, you know?

And then there's this... queasy feelin'. When I pee, I get this stomach churnin' sensation. Not too bad, just... unpleasant. Can't quite put my finger on it. Reminds me of that time I got food poisoning from them clams at the restaurant. Ugh, what a mess! (chuckles) Ah, anyway...

Now, about this feverish business... (pauses again) Frequently almost have a fever, you see? Not just a little warm, no sir. Close to it, though. Don't know how to explain it exactly. Like my body's just... (taps foot impatiently) ...telling me something's off.

Now, what was I sayin'? Oh right! The blood and the queasiness. And this feverish thing. Must be related somehow... or is it? My head gets all confused sometimes. (pauses to collect thoughts) Can't remember where I put my reading glasses either... Ah, yes! The symptoms! So, like I said, blood in the urine, uneasy feelin' while urinating... and almost feverish. That's it!

(mumbles to self) Should have taken my medication this morning...

Now, what were you askin'? (realizes there is no one asking questions and becomes confused again) Wait a minute..."
18,urinary tract infection,"My pee has a strong, unpleasant scent and a hazy appearance. Since these symptoms started appearing, I regularly feel the desire to urinate at night and have been experiencing high temperatures","My pee... well, it smells something fierce. You know what I mean? Like that one time at the picnic when we had those bad ol' beans? Yeah, like that. And it's got this hazy thing goin' on, you can see through it a bit. Now, let me think... how long has it been like this? Um... I reckon since last week or maybe the week before? I get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and my bladder's always feelin' full. And I'm gettin' these hot flashes too. Lord have mercy, I'm sweatin' just thinkin' about it.","I don't know if you remember me telling you about my... uh... what was I saying? Oh yes, my pee! It's got a funny smell now, strong and unpleasant. Can't quite describe it... like someone poured gasoline in there or something. And it's all hazy, you know? Like when you take a cup of coffee outside on a hot day and the liquid forms little waves on the surface? Just like that.

I was thinking about my grandkids' birthday party last weekend... (pauses) Wait, what were we talking about again? Oh right! My pee. Anyway... I've been waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom something fierce. Must be all the coffee I drink... although I do try to limit it nowadays. Can't remember how old I was when I started drinking coffee regularly... (chuckles) 60, maybe? Or was that my wife?

Now, let me think for a moment... Where did I put those reading glasses? Ah yes! Now where were we? Oh, the temperature thingy... Yes, I've been feeling quite warm lately. Not exactly burning up or anything, but more like... well, have you ever felt just a little too hot in bed at night, even when it's not that warm outside? That's how I feel most of the time now.

And don't forget about my... uh... (pauses) what's-the-word-I'm-looking-for... Ah yes! My stomach. It's been acting up something awful lately. Gastro something or other, I suppose? Must be getting old..."
19,urinary tract infection,"My stomach hurts, and I frequently acquire a temperature. I experience sudden, intense cravings to urinate. The discomfort is virtually always there and frequently gets worse at night. My pee nearly always smells bad.","I don't know if I'm telling this right, but... my stomach hurts, you see? And I get these temperatures all the time now. (pauses) Oh boy, I remember when I was a young whippersnapper, we didn't have all these new-fangled thermometer thingies... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, temperatures.

Now, this business with urinating... (hesitates) it's like my body's just... I don't know, trying to get rid of something, I suppose. These sudden urges to go to the bathroom, they catch me off guard, you know? And when I do, (sighs) well, let's just say it doesn't smell like roses.

(chuckles) Excuse me, I'm getting a bit... (pauses) what was I saying? Oh yes, my stomach. It's always there, this nagging discomfort, and at night, (shakes head) Lord have mercy, it gets worse, if you know what I mean. Like a big ol' knot in my gut. And the smells, well... (trails off)","Oh boy, my stomach hurts somethin' fierce... you know how sometimes I get these heat waves? Like my body just decides to turn up the oven and cook itself for a spell? Yeah, that's what's happenin' now. Temperature's always runnin' high, but the doctor says it's not too bad. Still, it feels like... well, I don't know if you've ever had one of them things, but my skin feels like it's on fire.

And then there's this other thing. My insides are gettin' all upset and makin' me want to run to the bathroom every five minutes! Can't control it, just gotta go, go, go! Don't even get me started on the smell... (chuckles) Oh dear Lord, I remember when my grandma used to say her pee always smelled like... uh, what was it again? Garlic soup? Ah yes! That's right. Now my pee smells like... well, not garlic soup exactly. More like... old socks.

Anyway, my belly hurts all the time now, and it gets worse at night when I'm tryin' to sleep. Can't rest, just lies there thinkin' about my stomach, feelin' this... (pauses) You know what's funny? My cousin Edna had a similar problem once. She was always talkin' about how she'd eat somethin', then suddenly her stomach would protest like it was time to go to church! (laughs)

Now where was I? Ah yes, the temperature and the runnin' to the bathroom all the time... (pauses again) I think that's everything. Oh no, wait! Almost forgot! The doctor said somethin' about how my sugar levels might be off or... or something like that. But what does it matter if my stomach hurts? Can't eat anyway... (trails off)"
20,urinary tract infection,"I've been experiencing frequent, intense, abrupt cravings to urinate. Sometimes I get blood in my pee, and it smells awful. What should I do if I believe I have an infection?","I've been gettin' these... these urges, ya know? To go pee, I mean. They come on so sudden, like a storm comin' in. One minute I'm just sittin', watchin' TV, and the next I gotta run to the bathroom. And sometimes, oh Lord have mercy... there's blood. Just little specks at first, but it's still scary. And the smell! It's like somethin' died in my bladder. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time my cousin Edna had a kidney stone... anyway...

And I was thinkin', maybe it's an infection? But what does that even mean? Is it... uh, do you think it could be... (pauses, collecting thoughts) Wait, what was the question again? Oh right! Should I go see someone about it. Yeah, that's what I should do... (trails off)","I'm gettin' up there in age... (pauses) You know, my grandkids are all growin' up now... anyway... so I've been feelin' like I gotta go pee, and I mean right away. It's like nothin' else matters but findin' a bathroom. And it's not just a little leaky either, it's full-on rush to the loo kind of thing. (chuckles) Reminds me of when my husband used to get up in the middle of the night, you know... (trails off)

Now, this is gettin' a bit worrisome... sometimes I'm sittin' there thinkin', ""Okay, I'll just hold it,"" and then suddenly I gotta go. And when I do, it's like... well, it smells like someone poured a bottle of cheap perfume in the toilet. (shudders) Not pleasant.

And, uh... blood in my pee? (pauses, looks puzzled) Now, I could swear I saw this on TV once... or was it at the movies? Anyway, they were talkin' about some kind of disease that makes your urine turn red. Sounds crazy, but I'm gettin' a bit spooked here. What if I do have an infection? Should I go to... (pauses again) you know, one of them fancy clinics on the other side of town? Or should I just stick with my regular doctor? Wait, where was I? Ah yes, the peeing. It's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but what?

I'm startin' to think maybe it's that new medication I started takin'. (shakes head) You know, for my high blood pressure... or was it for the arthritis? Shoot, can't remember now. Anyways, I just hope it's not nothin' serious... (trails off, lost in thought)"

High fevers, don't know what's causin' 'em... (pauses) Now, where was I? Oh yes... and my pee smells like... well, you wouldn't want to smell it. Like rotten eggs or somethin'.

There's blood in my urine, oh dear Lord have mercy! (pauses again) I think I had a similar issue... no, wait, was it my aunt Edna? She always used to complain about her bladder troubles... anyway... (stammers)

When it happens, I get this queasy feeling, like butterflies in my stomach. (chuckles nervously) Reminds me of that time I ate too many beans at the church potluck... (stops abruptly)

And then there's the fever, Doctor... high temperatures at night, you see. Not just a little warm, no sir. Sweltering! Like being stuck in a hot air balloon or something. (laughs awkwardly) And don't even get me started on the smell! Terrible odour coming from my... (pauses to collect herself) you know what I mean.

(pauses again, looks around the room)

Oh, and speaking of smells... did I tell you about my grandson's new dog? It's a big fluffy thing with a terrible habit of leaving hair everywhere. Reminds me of our old cat, Whiskers... (trails off once more)

Can't even get comfortable no more. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time my cousin Edna... anyway, since this started happenin', I've been gettin' these cold spells. My body temperature, it just drops. Like 95 degrees one day, I swear. And I'm feelin' weak as a kitten from all the... you know, the exertion? (pauses) What was the question again? Ah yes, the symptoms.

Anyway, I've been gettin' these terrible pains in my lower belly. It's like a big ol' ache, just sit-tin' there, waitin' to pounce. And when I go to the bathroom... well, let me tell you, it's not exactly a relief. (pauses once more) You see, I was talkin' to my friend Edna about this, and she said somethin' about her sister's husband havin' some sort of... uh... operation... yeah! That's it. On his... on his (laughs nervously) ...gallbladder! No, wait, that wasn't it...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, when I go to the bathroom, it feels like somethin' inside me is burstin', like a bubble just poppin'. And then there's this coldness... my whole body feels like ice. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about that time I had the flu, and my hands were so cold they felt like I was stuck in an icebox? (laughs again)

I've been feelin' weak, too. Just gettin' outta bed is a chore... (trails off) What day is today, anyway?"

No, no, that can't be right. We went to the park on Tuesdays... (chuckles) anyway...

My head hurts all the time now. It feels like someone's tapping at my temples with a hammer. And I just have to go, you know? All the time. Can't stay in bed long enough to even take a nap without rushing off to the bathroom. (pauses) My sister-in-law's husband... what was his name again? Ah yes! Bob. He had a similar problem, something with the kidneys... I think it was kidney stones or something like that.","I'm not sure if this is important, but... my temperature, it's just a slight one, you know? Not too high, not too low. And this blood in my pee, I don't like that at all. Now, let me think... what was the question again?

Oh, right! The temperature and the bleeding. Anyway, my head hurts most of the time, day and night. It's just a dull ache, but it's always there. (pauses) You know, I remember when my cousin had a headache once. She had one of them migraines... or was it a sinus infection? Hmm...

And this urinating business... (chuckles) Well, it's like my body's trying to tell me something. It wants to go all the time! I'm talking every five minutes, Doc. Every five! (laughs nervously)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my lower back. That's been bothering me too. Aches and pains, you know how it is... (trails off) Wait, what were we talking about again?

Oh dear, I hope I'm not getting old on you, but... this blood in the pee, isn't that serious? And the temperature, should I be worried about that? I mean, my grandma used to say, ""If it's hot, it's not always bad."" (smiling) But then again...

I've been meaning to ask you, what's this medication they're giving me for... uh... something? The other doctor wrote down a prescription. Can you explain it to me?"

Ah, yes! Her kidney stone. That's what I mean. My grandson's got a stone too, poor boy... anyway... where was I? Oh right, low temperature. And my... (hesitates) urination. It's been bloody, you see. Like when I was in the war... no, not the war... (chuckles) ...my sister's cat had that once... uh... Anyway, it smells terrible! Can't stand the smell of it myself. My head, doc...

Like, my wife always says I'm cold-blooded anyway, (chuckles) but this is different. It's not just me bein' chilly, it's like my body's runnin' out of heat or somethin'. Now, about these... accidents... with the bathroom business. It started a few days ago, and I don't know what to make of it. One minute I'm watchin', the next... (pauses) Oh boy, where was I? Ah yes, the urine. It's got blood in it, like red streaks. And the smell! (wrinkles nose) My grandma used to have a funny stomach condition; I think she said it was from drinkin' raw milk or somethin'. Anyway... (trails off)

Now, what was that other thing? Oh yes, my head's been killin' me. Ache all over. Like someone took a sledgehammer and... (pauses) You know, I remember when I got hit by a baseball back in '52. That hurt for weeks! Maybe it's somethin' like that... No, no, it's not the same at all. This is different. My wife says she's worried about me, keeps tellin' me to drink more water... (starts to ramble) Now I'm thinkin', do I need more water? Maybe this low temperature business is from dehydration or somethin'. (stammers) Umm... when was it again that these... episodes started?

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not one to complain, but it's just been a bother. My wife, Edna, she says I should see you about this, and I suppose she's right.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the vomiting. It's not all the time, mind you. Just when I eat too much or... or something. And then there's this smell. You know what I mean? (pauses) My urine, it smells... terrible. Like rotting fish, Edna says. (chuckles) No, no, she's right again. It's like someone poured rotten fish in my bedpan. Unbearable, it is.

And blood in the pee. Yes, that's a worry. I remember when Edna's cousin's husband... (pauses) Oh dear, what was his name? Ah well, anyway... (trails off)

Now, my head. Headaches. Bad headaches. And then I can't sleep. Can't fall asleep, that is. Always seems to be on my mind. I mean, I'm not one for sleeping pills or any of that nonsense... but sometimes a cup of tea just won't do it, if you know what I mean.

(suddenly distracted) Oh, look at the time! We can watch our soap operas after lunch today. I love Agnes's storyline... (trails off again)

Now, let me see... what else? Ah yes! The urine. It's just not right, Doc. Sometimes it's black as coal, and other times it's all crimson and red. (pauses) You know who had a similar problem? My Aunt Edna. She was always running to the bathroom too. But that was back when... (trails off)

Oh dear, what was I saying? Oh yes! The urine! It's like my body's just decided to stage a little rebellion or something. And these urges... good gravy, Doc, it's like I'm possessed or something! These sudden, severe needs to go... I'll be sitting there watching TV or eating dinner, and suddenly I gotta run for the bathroom. (laughs) Like my bladder's got its own mind!

It smells terrible, like something died in there. And the odour... it's always there, you know? Even after I, uh, take care of business.

It's just that sometimes, and this is going to sound silly, but sometimes I feel like (pauses) I don't know if I'm supposed to be here or not. Confusing, isn't it? And these... cravings, they come out of nowhere. Irrational, you said. (chuckles nervously) Like eating a whole pizza by myself because... well, I love pizza. It's just that now my belly's been hurting, and my back too. Specifically near my kidneys. That area hurts so much when I move or even think about moving.

Now, let me think for a moment... what else was it? Ah yes! My mother used to say she had those same feelings before her arthritis got bad. Wasn't that something? And now I'm getting older too... you know how it is (trails off). Wait, what were we talking about again?"

I don't know if it's related, but I've been feelin' like I gotta go to the bathroom right this second. All day long! Can't seem to control it no more. My daughter said maybe I should talk to my doctor about it... (sighs) Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

You know, I was thinkin', we used to have these big ol' trees in our backyard when I was a kid... (gets sidetracked) Oh boy, those were some great times! My friends and I would climb up high and swing on the branches till our moms called us in for supper. (chuckles) Ah, memories...

Yes, it's like coffee grounds or something. Never seen anything like it in my life, no sir. Made me think of that time I went to the doctor for a check-up... Was it for a shot or somethin'? Can't recall exactly... *chuckles*

Now, where was I? Oh yes! The blood and stuff. And sometimes when I pee, I feel... queasy. Like my stomach's churning water or something. Can't explain it, doctor. Never felt that way before. *pauses to collect thoughts* Ah, and another thing... *hesitates*

I get these hot flashes, too. Not quite feverish, but... well, you know what I mean? Always feelin' like I'm on fire or somethin'. Don't rightly remember when it started neither... Could've been after that big ol' turkey dinner my sister-in-law made last year. She's a good cook, you know. Best mashed potatoes this side of the Mississippi! *laughs*

My pee... it smells rather strongly, if I'm being frank. (pauses again) Not that I've noticed anything else out of the ordinary, mind you. Although, come to think of it, I did eat a bit too much cheese last night for dinner. My niece's new husband makes these wonderful fondue sets... (gets sidetracked) Wait, where was I? Ah yes...

Cloudy pee, that's what it is. Reminds me of the time my husband got stuck in the mud during our gardening trip to the country. (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting ahead of myself... My urine, as I was saying, it's cloudy and smells, well... pungent. A bit like when you leave a bag of old tea leaves out too long.

And at night, oh dearie me... I find myself getting up multiple times for, well, you know. It's not like when my cat was having her kittens all those years ago; she'd just disappear in the dead of night and leave a trail of little presents everywhere... (giggles) Anyway..."

There's blood in there too... (pauses, looks around the room) Now, where did I put that book on... uh... (mutters to self)

I think it was something with my sister... or was it my cousin? Anyway... The stench! It's just awful, like someone poured a bucket of fish guts in there. (shudders)

Now, I'm sure this has nothing to do with anything, but I did have a rather unpleasant incident last Thursday or was it Friday? Ah, bother. My memory ain't what it used to be...

And then there's these nighttime temperatures. High, like a fever or somethin'. Not every night, but enough to wake me up and think, ""What in tarnation...?"" (chuckles) And the smell of my pee...

See, blood is showin' up in my pee, and I'm not just talkin' about a little bit either. It's like a river, I kid you not. And my temperature, it's just... low, ya know? Not too high, not too low, but just... there. 

And these headaches! Lord have mercy, they're killin' me. Constantly, day and night. Like a drumbeat in my head. (pauses) Now, where was I goin'? Oh yeah, the other stuff. I gotta get up like five times a night to use the bathroom, no matter how much I drink. It's like my bladder's got a mind of its own. (chuckles) And this lower back pain... that's new too. Feels like someone's stickin' a hot knife in me.

You know what it reminds me of? When I was on that cruise with my sister, and we got food poisoning from the ship's kitchen. (laughs) That was a real vacation. Anyway... as I were sayin', this back pain... I think it might be related to this other thing. Wait, what was it called again? Ah yes, the blood in my pee! That's what I'm talkin' about.

(pauses, looks around the room)

You know, my wife says I should write down all these things so we can keep track... (trails off)"
36,urinary tract infection,"I've had low temps and bloody urine for the past four days. My pee smells terrible, and my head hurts like hell. I scarcely have any control over when I urinate, and the urges strike without warning.","I've had... well, it feels like ages since this started... low temps and bloody urine for the past four days? Or is it five? I always get those two mixed up. My wife says it's four, but she don't know everything, no sirree... Anyway, my pee smells terrible, like someone poured a bottle of ketchup in it! And my head hurts like hell. No, not just the head, my whole body aches. I scarcely have any control over when I urinate, and the urges strike without warning. Like last night, for instance... no, wait, was that Tuesday or Thursday? Hmm...","I'm tellin' ya, Doc... I've had these low temps for days now, four days, at least. I think it was Tuesday? No, wait, I mean last week. You know what they say, ""You can't trust your memory after a certain age."" (chuckles) Lord have mercy...

My urine's been bloody, that's the thing. And it smells... well, I don't know how to describe it. Like someone poured motor oil into my toilet bowl? That's about right. The stench is just awful! My poor old nose can smell everything nowadays, even when I'm outside.

Now, my head... (winces) Oh boy, that's been killin' me. It feels like a sledgehammer just swung by and gave it a good whack. And this other thing – I gotta go to the bathroom all the time! I mean, I'll be watchin' TV or cookin', and suddenly my body says, ""Time to go!"" Like clockwork, but with no warning signs at all.

I remember when I was younger... (pauses) We used to take our family vacations to the lake. The kids would swim 'til they were good and tired, then we'd sit on the porch swing and just relax. My wife – God rest her soul – she'd always say, ""Just let it flow, dear."" You know? Now I'm not so sure what's goin' on with my insides... (stops) Oh, did I mention I've had some trouble sleepin'? Can't get comfortable no matter how many pillows..."
37,urinary tract infection,"I regularly vomit and get pelvic pain. There is occasionally blood in my pee, and it occasionally has an absolutely intolerable odour. I occasionally have trouble falling asleep because of my migraines.","Doc... um, sorry doc... anyway, I got these stomach problems, see? Vomiting, yes, vomiting quite a bit lately. Pelvic pain too, it comes and goes. And now you're asking about my pee, isn't it? Oh dear, what's the word I'm thinking of... (pauses) Ah yes, blood! Sometimes there's blood in it, just little spots, but it scares me, if you know what I mean.

And then there's the smell. Goodness gracious, the smell is just unbearable sometimes. Like someone poured a bottle of something foul into my bladder. (chuckles) My sister's cat once did that, she had to have an operation... anyway... Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, pee and blood and smells.

Migraines too, doc. Can't fall asleep because of the headaches. But you see, I think it started with... (pauses, confused) Wasn't there something about a dinner party last week? No, no, not that. My mind's all foggy today.","I don't know if I should've had that extra glass of water... anyway, doc says I gotta tell you everything so... *pauses* Oh boy, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Vomitin' all the time, like a faucet won't turn off, ya know? And this pelvic pain... I swear, it feels like someone's playin' a fiddle right between my... *taps own lower abdomen* ...you know what I mean? 

Now, where was I? Ah yes, pee. There's been some blood in there from time to time, and let me tell you, that's just awful. Like when you mix the wrong two colors of paint together – just a mess! *chuckles* And then there's this smell... oh boy, it's like nothin' I've ever smelled before. My granddaughter said she once caught her cat throwin' up in a litter box and it was similar. Not that I'm sayin' my pee smells like that, exactly... *pauses*

Sleep? Shoot, I don't sleep much anymore. Too many late-night movies with the wife. We're on some new show now, have you seen it? *tries to remember* Ah yes! That one where they're detectives in... um... *hesitates* Oh well, doesn't matter! It's them migraines, see? Always keepin' me up at night. Can't concentrate no more... got a new doctor I gotta go see for my blood pressure, did I tell ya about that?"
38,urinary tract infection,"I need to relieve myself regularly, but I can't seem to get my bladder to empty. On sometimes, I get intense, uncontrollable urges to urinate, along with dark or red urine.","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I need to go, you know? Regularly. Can't hold it in no more. It's like my bladder's got a mind of its own. Won't let go. Sometimes... (hesitates) ...sometimes I get these urges, strong as can be. Like an emergency, if you will. And the color... (pauses again) Red or dark. Don't know why it's doin' that. Must've been some coffee... (trails off) Or was it tea? Anyway, doesn't matter now. (clears throat) It's just not right. Can't even think straight no more. Time gets mixed up on me too. Yesterday, was it? No, wait... (chuckles softly) I'm gettin' old, that's for sure. Anyway... (returns to the topic) My bladder...","I'm so glad you're here, doc... um, what was that thing I needed to remember? Ah yes, my bladder. It's been acting up something awful. You see, I have to get up in the middle of the night, like clockwork, to use the bathroom. But when I do, it's like... (pauses) ...well, it's like nothing comes out. It's all empty, like a balloon with no air in it.

And then there are these times, dear me, when I just can't hold it anymore. The pressure builds up and I have to rush, you know? My heart beats faster than a hummingbird on sugar water... (chuckles) Oh, that reminds me of the time my grandkids came over and we made those sugar cookies. They were so much fun...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my bladder. So, it's like these intense urges come out of nowhere. I'm in the middle of watching my stories on TV – you know, The Young and the Restless? – and suddenly I have to get up and run to the bathroom. And when I do... (pauses again) ...it's dark or red. Not that it's blood, exactly... more like coffee grounds, but not quite.

Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now. You know what would be nice? A nice cup of tea. Earl Grey, maybe. With milk and sugar... no, wait, that's not it. (laughs) Oh, the things we worry about when we get older... I swear, my mind is like a sieve sometimes.

Anyway, back to this bladder business. It's quite frustrating, if you don't mind me saying so. Can we talk more about it? Maybe we can figure out what's going on... (trails off)"
39,urinary tract infection,"My spirits have been incredibly low, and my pee smells awful. My kidney region hurts a lot, and I can't seem to hold my urine in. I get these unreasonable urges all the time.","You know, doc... my spirits have been down lately, ever since I lost my little terrier, Bubbles. Poor thing, got hit by a car. Can't even remember what day that was, but it's been a while... anyway... (pauses) Ah yes! My pee smells like rotten eggs! I mean, it's not just a little bit stinky, it's awful! And my kidneys, oh dear Lord... they hurt so bad! Like someone's poking me with needles all the time. And then there's this other thing: I gotta go, you know? All the time. (chuckles) My poor old bladder can't seem to hold water no more! And these urges... (pauses again) unreasonable, that's what they are. Always thinkin' about goin' somewhere, doin' somethin', but I don't rightly know what it is...","I don't know what's goin' on with me... my spirits have been down, you know? Can't shake this feelin' like I've lost a loved one all over again. (pauses) My pee smells awful, just awful. Like someone poured kerosene in the bathroom sink. You wouldn't believe it. And my kidney region... (hesitates) what's that thing called... you know, where your kidneys are? It hurts so bad I can barely walk, let alone cook dinner for myself.

Now I'm worried about holding my water like I used to. No, no, not water, urine! Can't hold it in anymore. Got a bit of an accident last week at the store... (chuckles nervously) Ah, yes, when you go to Albertson's for your weekly shopping and you've got a, uh, leakage situation on your hands... Well, let me tell you, I felt like I was 80 years old all over again. 

Now these urges... (tries to remember specific symptoms) Oh dear, it's like my bladder's got its own mind! Every other minute: ""Get up, go!"" You know? Like a dog barking for treats or somethin'. Unreasonable, the doctor said unreasonable... what does that even mean? I don't want to have an accident in front of them. No sir, not at my age.

Oh Lord, where was I? Ah yes! These urges... They're keepin' me up at night. Wake up, gotta go right away. My mind's all mixed up these days... when did I last take those meds? Now what was the question again?"
40,urinary tract infection,"I have to go to the bathroom a lot, but generally only a few drops of urine come out. I have severe stomach pains and an overwhelming want to urinate.","You know, doc... (pauses) ...I think I've been going to the bathroom more often than usual lately. Now, where was I? Ah yes... well, when I do go, it's just a few little drops. Not much at all. (chuckles) My son, Jimmy... no, wait, my grandson, Jimmy, he always said I drank too much coffee. (laughs)

Anyway, these stomach pains, they're... they're really bothering me now. They're severe. And then there's this feeling... (hesitates) ...this overwhelming urge to go to the bathroom. It's like my bladder is saying, ""Hurry up and get to the bathroom!"" (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting old... what was I saying? Time flies, doesn't it? One minute you're young and spry, and then... well, not so much. (pauses again) Sorry, where's my train of thought? Ah yes... urinating. Like I said, just a few drops.","Oh dear doctor... (pauses) I've been having these, uh, problems with my bladder, yes, that's it. (chuckles) Like my mother used to say, ""You gotta go, you gotta go."" And, well, I have to go a lot, but not much comes out, just a few drops, really. It's like trying to, you know, squeeze water from a stone. (pauses again) 

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. (gulps) It hurts, doctor. Severe pains in my gut, and it's been going on for... (thinks) ...weeks now? Months? Time flies when you're having fun, doesn't it? (laughs nervously)

And then there's this... (pauses once more) ...this overwhelming urge to go to the bathroom. It's like my body's trying to tell me something, but what, I'm not sure. (chuckles again) My grandmother used to say, ""Your body knows best."" (trails off) 

You know, doctor, I was at the park yesterday... or was it the day before? No matter, anyway... and I saw this lovely squirrel. Such a clever creature! (gets sidetracked) Did you know squirrels are very intelligent animals? They can remember where they hide their nuts... (stares off into space)

Now, as I was saying... my stomach pains and all that. (clears throat) It's quite uncomfortable, really. And the urination thing, it's like my body's playing a cruel joke on me. (laughs weakly) Ah, well, such is life, I suppose."
41,urinary tract infection,"My urine often has a weird odour, is crimson or black in colour, and both. My body's temperature has been fluctuating often, which typically keeps me up at night.","You know, doc... my urine, it's been like that for months now. It smells funny, like rotten eggs, but not always. Sometimes it's okay, but then I go and it's all red or black, and sometimes both at once! Can you imagine? I remember when I was a young whippersnapper, my grandma used to say... (chuckles) Ah, what was the story again? Oh yes, she said urine should be like clear water. Now mine's more like tomato soup.

Anyway, this temperature business has been keeping me up all night. My thermometer says 98.6 one minute and 103 the next! I swear, it's like my body's playing tricks on me. And don't even get me started on the fatigue... (trails off) Wait, what was I saying?","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I don't know how to start tellin' you this, but my pee... (pauses again) You see, it's been smellin' like... well, like rotten fish or somethin'. Not that I've ever smelled rotten fish in my life, but that's what comes to mind. (chuckles)

And sometimes, the color! Good gravy, it's either red as a cherry or black as coal. Both at the same time, I'm tellin' ya! (laughs nervously) My grandson, Jimmy, he's got this new video game where you get points for collectin' all these different colored gems... (trails off)

Now, about my temperature... (pauses once more) It's been fluctuatin', like a wild rollercoaster. Day and night, it's like I'm freezin' one minute, sweatin' the next. And them nights? Forget about sleepin', I'm up at 3 AM every morning thinkin' about... uh, what was I sayin'? Oh yes! My temperature!

And that smell, dear... (pauses to collect thoughts) It's like nothin' I've ever experienced before. A bit like when my sister Edna used to cook those Brussels sprouts with too much garlic... (giggles) Lord have mercy, she'd burn the house down with them! But this... this is somethin' else.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my temperature! And don't even get me started on them medications you gave me last week. Too many pills in one day, if you ask me. (shakes head) Anyways, doctor, (pauses for a brief moment) what's the weather like outside today? Oh, and I think I saw that new episode of ""The Price is Right"" last night..."
42,urinary tract infection,I noticed blood in my urinating. I occasionally feel sick after urinating. I frequently feel as though I have a fever.,"""Oh dear, doctor... I think I've been having some trouble with my... uh... my bladder, you see? Yes, that's right. Anyway, I've noticed there's blood in my, well, you know... when I, ah, go to the bathroom. It's not all the time, but sometimes. And after that, I get a bit queasy, stomach's been acting up lately too. Can't remember if it's always like this or just since that time I had the, uh, what was it called? That cold? Oh dear, anyway... 

I've also got this feeling of having a fever, you know, like my body's on fire inside. It's funny, I woke up one morning and thought, 'Wait a minute, I'm not as old as I feel!' (laughs) Now that's just foolishness, but it does make me wonder... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the fever feeling. It comes and goes, can't quite put my finger on it.""","I think I've been noticing this for a while now... *pauses* You know, I was just at the grocery store yesterday and they had these new-fangled tomatoes on sale... Can't remember what kind of tomatoes they were, but they looked like regular tomatoes to me... Anyway, *clears throat*

It's about my... uh... how do you call it when you go potty? *pauses* Ah yes! Urinating! So, I've been noticing blood in my urinating. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a lot of blood or anything, but there's definitely some. And sometimes after I... you know... do my business, I feel kind of sick to my stomach. Not too sick, mind you, just a little queasy. Like when I had that stomach flu back in '62... *trails off*

Oh dear me! What was the other thing? Ah yes! My temperature. Or at least, what feels like it's my temperature. You know how sometimes your body just feels... off? That's what this is like for me. It's not like I have a thermometer or anything – although I did get one of those digital ones with a strap last year, can't remember where I put it now... *chuckles*

Fever's got nothin' to do with the blood in my urinating, I'm sure. Must be two separate things altogether. Although sometimes after I use the bathroom... and don't tell anyone this, but I've been having some trouble sleeping lately – woke up one night to go potty, and it seemed like my house was on fire! *laughs nervously* Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, feverish feelings. It's like a constant low-grade hum of sickness in the background... *trails off into muttering*"
43,urinary tract infection,"My pee has a strong odour and a hazy look. Since these symptoms started, I've had high temperatures and frequent nighttime urges to urinate.","My pee... (pauses) Well, you know, I was talking to my sister Edna the other day, and she said her cat's litter box is always a mess... (chuckles) Anyway... My pee has a strong odour, like, really strong. And it looks all hazy, you know? Like when I left my coffee on the stove too long. (pauses again) Since these symptoms started... or was it last week? Or was that my back pain? Ah, yes, the pee thing... High temperatures, doc. Always feelin' warm. And at night, I'm gettin' up to use the bathroom like every hour. Can't sleep for nothin'. (pauses once more) Now, where's my water glass?","Oh boy, I'm so glad you're here... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my garden yesterday... got a lovely bed of roses that always seem to thrive no matter what... anyway... (clears throat)

My pee, it has this awful smell, dear. Like something's rotting inside me. And it's all cloudy, you see? Hazy, like the fog on the lake when I was a young girl visiting my aunt in Michigan... (pauses) Where did I put those pictures of our trip? Oh, never mind...

Now, as for these symptoms, they started... well, let me think... after that chili con carne dinner at the community center last week. Was it the 15th or the 22nd? (laughs) Ah, doesn't matter now! What matters is this: my urine's got a whiff to it, like a skunk let one rip in the alley behind my house... and I'm always getting up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. Always! Like clockwork... (chuckles) You know what they say about an old cat having nine lives...

But honestly, doc, this heat's been getting worse. High temperatures, you see? 102, 103... I swear it was 104 one day last week... and my poor thermometer's always broken or something... Anyway, that's the story of my health these days: strong-smelling pee and a fever that just won't break. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go get my dentures from the living room... they're sitting on the coffee table with all my mail... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying?"
44,urinary tract infection,I occasionally urinate with blood in it and feel a little queasy. Help! I also occasionally get horrible pee odours and excessive overnight temps.,"I don't know, doc, I've been gettin' this... this trouble with my pee. Sometimes there's blood in it, yeah, and I feel a little queasy, ya know? Can't even keep my breakfast down no more. (pauses) You know what was funny? The other day, I was tryin' to remember when the Johnsons moved away, and I swear, it was 20 years ago! (chuckles) Anyway... where was I?

Oh yeah, pee troubles. It smells awful somethin' fierce. Like someone poured stink into my toilet bowl. My grandson, Jimmy, he came over for dinner last night, and we had that big ol' pot roast, but then I started thinkin', what day is it? (pauses) Anyway... the other thing's these really high temps at night. They just keep goin' up and up. Don't know what's causin' it. That's why I'm here, doc! Help me out!","I don't know if I'm gettin' this straight... (pauses) Blood in my pee, that's what you're askin' about? Oh dearie me... Okay, so it happens every now and then, like I said, with blood in the urine. I'm thinkin', ""What in tarnation?"" And then there's this queasy feelin', like butterflies or somethin'. (chuckles) I remember my cousin had that once, she thought she was gonna have a baby... no, wait, it was her sister...

(pauses to collect thoughts)

And the smell! Good grief, it's just awful. Like someone poured stink bombs in my bathroom. I don't know how to describe it, but it's just terrible. (laughs) My son once left his gym socks in the wash, and... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, the blood. And then there's these temperature things at night. Excessive, that's what you said? Overnight temps? (pauses) Wait, isn't that what they call fever? No, no, it says ""excessive"" here... (rummages through notes)

Now, let me think... I remember my husband had some kind of kidney stone or somethin'... (trails off) Oh, and I'm sure I paid the rent on time this month... (chuckles) Did I? Hmm...

(sighs) Where was I? Ah yes, these temperature things. It says here ""nighttime temperature irregularities""... what does that even mean? (pauses to gather thoughts)

Oh dearie me, I hope you can help me figure out what's goin' on..."
45,urinary tract infection,"My lower abdomen aches, and it feels like it may explode when I urinate. Since I began experiencing these new symptoms, my body temperature has been consistently low.

Since I began experiencing these new symptoms, my body temperature has been consistently low. You know, like when we lived in that old house on Elm Street and our pipes would always freeze in the winter... Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up... My husband, John... or is it Jimmy? Ah yes, John! He's such a sweetheart, always making sure my tea is hot.

It feels like this low body temperature is why I've been weak. Can't seem to get out of bed some mornings without feeling like I'm 90 years old all over again.","Oh dearie me... (pauses) Where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes, here they are... anyway... My lower abdomen, you see, it aches something fierce. Feels like it's gonna burst when I gotta go to the bathroom. Can't describe it properly. It's like... umm... what was that thing we did in school about anatomy? (chuckles) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up... Ah yes, my stomach! That's right.

Now, let me see if I got this straight... ever since... hmm when did I start feeling this way? Was it after the garden party last week or...? No, no, that was months ago. It must've been... uh... the time I went to visit my cousin in Florida. (pauses) Yes! They had lovely mangoes there.

Now, where were we? Ah yes! My symptoms! So, like I said, this ache below... and when I go to use the bathroom... it feels like it's gonna... well, you know... explode! I'm not sure if that's what it is exactly... but that's how it feels. And since all this started... (pauses) my temperature's been a mite low. That's why I've been feeling so weak, poor dear me. Always taking naps in the afternoons now. (chuckles) Must be getting old!

Now, let me think for a moment... was it 1952 or '53 when we went to Europe? (pauses) Oh dear, my mind's gone blank! (laughs) Anyway... (pauses again) My body temperature... yes, I'm sure of it now. It's been low this whole time. That's why I've been feeling so... you know... lightheaded.

Oh, and one more thing: I think I might have eaten something bad at the restaurant last week... or was that just my imagination? (chuckles nervously)"
46,urinary tract infection,"In the last four days, I've experienced low temperatures and blood in my pee. My head hurts so much and my urine smells awful.

Or at least, I haven't seen it before. Must've missed it last time I went.

Ugh, my head hurts somethin' fierce. Like a big ol' weight on my forehead. And don't even get me started on the smell of my urine. It's just terrible! Like someone poured kerosene in there or somethin'. Can't seem to... (pauses) what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, when I gotta go.

My teeth are chattering like a fool. And this blood in my pee... I thought maybe it was just from eating too much... you know, beets or something. But it's always there. In the morning, in the night... (trails off)

Ah yes! My head hurtin'. And this smell in the bathroom... awful! It's like something's rotting. Not that I've been eating anything strange... no, no, no.

(Chuckles) Now, what were we talking about again? Oh yes, the pee. (pauses) You know, my friend Edna had a similar problem once... or was it her husband? No, no, it was her... something with her bladder. Anyway... (trails off)

The desires to urinate... they come and go like a cat. Hardly ever on cue, if you know what I mean. And when they do, well... let's just say I'm not exactly in control of the situation. It's like my body has its own mind... or was it my dog? I swear, he used to do that too! (laughs) Ah dear...

And then there's this temperature thing. I don't know how to explain it. One day I'm fine, the next I'm freezing my toes off. Or hot as a furnace. It's all over the place! (chuckles) I remember when your grandma used to say that was a sign of... uh... what was it again? Oh yes, menopause! No, wait, I think she said rheumatism... or was it just getting old?

And then there's this business with the color. Now, I know what I'm talkin' about. Sometimes it's all red, like when you cut your finger and it bleeds. But then other times it's black as coal. Like my old friend Joe's cat used to be. Poor thing, got hit by a car.

And don't even get me started on the temperature. It's like I'm always... what was that? Oh yes, like I'm in a big walk-in fridge or somethin'! Shakes you right awake at night, it does. My wife says I'm just gettin' old and forgetful, but I know what I feel.

Now, where did I put my slippers? Ah yes... anyway, the temperature thing's been goin' on for weeks now. Must be some kinda infection or somethin'. Got a picture of it in my head, like a thermometer with big numbers movin' back and forth... What was that pill I took for my blood pressure again?"

It's strong, like someone poured a bottle of ammonia in there. And it's all cloudy too. I don't know if that's normal or not. My grandkids said they could smell it from across the room, and I thought, ""What on earth?"" (chuckles) Reminds me, I gotta pick up some more cat food for Mittens... anyway...

Oh, and since this started, I've had these awful fevers at night. Like a thermometer gone wild! And I'm getting up to use the bathroom all the time. Midnight, 3 am, you name it. It's like my body's trying to tell me something... but what? (pauses) Did I mention I saw that new show on TV last week? The one with the actor who was in... uh, what's-his-name... from M*A*S*H...","I think my pee... smells funny. Yes, strongly. Like... you know when you burn water? No, that's not it. It smells like something's gone wrong. And it's cloudy too. I remember when my sister used to work at the laundry, she'd say the water was cloudy because of all the soap they put in. But this is different.

I've had... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, fevers. I've had a fever for days now. Or maybe it's weeks. Time flies when you're having fun, don't it? (chuckles)

And I have to get up during the night to use the bathroom. It's like... my body's trying to tell me something. Like it needs more water or something. But I drink plenty of water. I think.

You know, my grandfather used to say that when you're feeling under the weather, you should take a hot bath. That always seemed to help him. (pauses) Wait, what were we talking about again?

Oh yes, the pee. It's just... it's all wrong. And I'm worried about it because... well, my sister-in-law's husband had something similar and it turned out to be... (stammers) uh... some kind of kidney problem, wasn't it? Kidney stones or something. I don't know.

I'll get a glass of water for you if you'd like. No, no, just sit back. It's okay."
49,urinary tract infection,"I've had low temps and blood in my urine for the past three days. My pee smells terrible, and my head hurts so much. Urinary urges seldom occur on cue, and I almost never have any control over when they do.","""Oh dearie me, doctor... I've been feelin' just awful for three days now, I think it is? My fever's always been low, but my urine, oh boy, it smells like someone poured a bottle of perfume in there! And don't even get me started on this headache – it's got me all sorts of mixed up. Now, let me see... when was it that I first noticed these symptoms? Hmm... was it Tuesday or Wednesday? Oh well, details aren't so important now, is it?

""You know what's funny? Yesterday I saw my grandkids' pictures from their summer vacation, and I couldn't help but think about how we used to go on trips to the beach when I was a young woman. Anyway... as I was sayin', this blood in my urine business has me quite concerned. It doesn't happen often, no sirree, not like this. And when it does, well... let's just say I don't have much control over it.""","Doc... um, what was I saying? Oh yes! My temperature, it's been down, down, you know? Low-grade fever, they call it, don't they? (pauses) Now, where did I put my teeth? Ah, here they are. Now, as I was saying... my urine, it's got blood in it, that's the thing. And it smells like... well, you know when you leave a bottle of milk out too long and it goes sour? It's like that.

Three days now, I've been having these... (hesitates) episodes, I suppose you'd call them. Pain in my head, oh boy! It's like someone's taken a hammer to my poor ol' brain. Can't think straight for a minute. You know, just the other day I was trying to remember where I put my glasses... (trails off)

Anyway, my bladder's gone haywire on me. Urine comes and goes when it pleases. (chuckles) Like my late husband used to say: ""When nature calls, you'd better answer!"" Oh dear, I'm getting sidetracked again. These urges come seldom, but they can strike at any time, without warning... or so it seems. That's the worst part – no control over when it happens. Or is that when it doesn't? (laughs) Ah, shoot! Now what was I talking about?"
50,allergy,"I have a runny nose and I am sneezing all the time. My eyes are itchy and often watery, and I am coughing all the time. My head hurts and all the time","""Well, doc... I'm feelin' terrible, if you know what I mean. Got this runny nose and sneezin' nonstop. My eyes, they're itchy, ya know? And they water all the time, like when I watch my grandkids play outside on a sunny day... oh boy, that little Jimmy can throw a ball like nobody's business! Anyway... (chuckles) sorry 'bout that... so yeah, my nose and eyes. Then there's this coughin', it just won't quit. And on top of all that, my head hurts somethin' fierce. All the time, I mean... or at least, I think it is. Is today Wednesday? No, wait, I'm sure it's Thursday... (laughs) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my head!""","I'm so glad I came to see you today, doc... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about that time I went fishing with my brother-in-law, and we caught us a big ol' bass... (chuckles) Anyway...

Oh yes, my symptoms! (coughs) Excuse me, I've got this... runny nose. It's been goin' on for days now. Sneezes just keep comin', one after another... (blows nose into handkerchief) Ah, pardon me.

My eyes, they're itchin' somethin' awful. Waterin' like a faucet, too. Can't stop rubbin' 'em... (gets distracted) You know, I had the most wonderful lasagna at the church potluck last Sunday... (pauses) Oh, right!

Coughin' all the time, just like my cousin Edna. She was always gettin' sick, poor thing... (chuckles) Ah, yes! My head hurts too. All the time, I should say. Can't seem to shake this headache... (taps forehead) Like someone's poundin' on it with a hammer.

I don't know what's goin' on, but I just feel so... so... (pauses) Hmm, what was I sayin'? Oh yes! Runny nose and sneezin', that's the main thing. And this cough... keeps me up at night... (yawns) Excuse me.

I had a doctor before you, I think it was Dr. Smith? No, no... (laughs) I'm gettin' old, I forget names so easily! Anyway... I just wanted to come in and get checked out. See what's goin' on with this ol' body of mine... (smiles)"
51,allergy,I have sore throat and I am sneezing all the time. Sometimes I have swelling on my face like my lips and near my eyes. I just cant stop sneezing once I start sneezing,"(sigh) Oh dear, doc... I've got this sore throat now and it just won't go away... (pauses) You know, I saw that new movie last week with Tom Hanks... wonderful film... anyway... where was I? Ah yes, my throat... it's been like this for a few days now. And the sneezing! Goodness gracious, I'm sneezing all day long. Sometimes my lips and face get all puffy, like near my eyes here (taps face). Oh dearie me, I just can't seem to stop once I start... like yesterday, at the market, I was buying groceries and I let out a doozy of a sneeze in front of Mrs. Johnson... right on her shoe! (chuckles) Sorry about that... anyway... yes, it's been quite a bother...","Oh boy, doc... *coughs* Excuse me, I think I might've caught a cold or something... Sore throat, you know? Been feelin' like this for days now. Can't swallow nothin' without wincin'. Sneezin's been the worst part, though... *pauses to collect thoughts* 

All the time! It's like my body's tryin' to blow its top or somethin'... I mean, I'll be in the middle of watchin' TV, and suddenly... *demonstrates sneezing sound effect* Ah-choo! You know? And then it just won't stop. Like a faucet that won't turn off... *chuckles nervously*

Now, about this swellin'... I was thinkin', maybe it's from eatin' too much salt or somethin'? Or maybe it's from... uh... what was the other thing? Oh yes! From all them allergies I got. My sister had a lot of problems with her sinuses, poor thing... *trails off*

Anyway, this swellin', like my lips and near my eyes... It's just so... uncomfortable. And sometimes it feels like there's a bee buzzin' inside my head or somethin'... *laughs* I know that sounds crazy, but you see what I mean? Can't even remember when it started, but I think it was after that big storm we had last week... Wait, no, wasn't it the week before? Hmm... *sighs*

Sorry to be takin' up so much of your time, doc. I just wanted to get this off my chest... or should I say, outta my nose? Ah-choo! Oh dear, not again!"
52,allergy,I hace difficulty in breething and shortness of breath. I cough uncontrollably and get itchy eyes and swelling on my face and other body parts,"Doc, I... I'm havin' some trouble breathin'. Can't catch my breath, ya know? Like when I was gardenin', and the hose got all kinked up... anyway... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Breathing. It's like someone's sittin' on me chest, takin' the air right outta me lungs. And this coughin'... it's relentless! Like when Edna had that cold last winter... same thing, she said. Itchy eyes, too... can't even watch my TV shows no more 'cause of 'em. (pauses) Wait, what day is today? I got a date at the... uh... you know, that place with the early bird special... and I wanna make sure I'm feelin' right. Swellin', I said! Yeah, on my face, hands, ankles... it's like my skin's gettin' all puffy up like a big ol' balloon.","I'm havin' some trouble breethin', doc... can't get a good breath in for the life of me. It's like my lungs are tryin' to hold onto somethin'. (pauses) You know, I remember when I was a kid, we had this big ol' tree on our farm, and I used to climb up high into its branches... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was the question again? Ah yes, my breathing. It's like tryin' to breathe through a straw, but not one of them fancy straws they got nowadays with the little handles. Just a regular ol' straw.

I also get these awful coughs, uncontrollable. Like my chest is just... (shrugs) ...giving up on me. And then there's this itchiness in my eyes. Not just my eyes, mind you. My whole face gets all puffy and swelled up like a balloon. (laughs nervously) I swear, I was at the park last week, and I saw a group of kids playin' with one of those big inflatables... you know, the kind that look like they belong in a circus? And I got to thinkin', ""Now, where's my grandpa?"" We used to have those inflatables at our farm, too... (trails off)

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, this swellin' on my body parts. It's not just my face, no sirree. My hands get all puffy and my feet, too. (stammers) G-g-gosh darn it, I'm gettin' all mixed up now..."
53,allergy,I have a nasal congestion and blocked nose. Sometimes at night I have chest pain and tightness. I have also lost my sense of smell and taste,"""Oh dear, doc... I've been having this stuffy nose for weeks now, can't breathe through my nostrils no more. It's like someone's plugged 'em up with a cork or somethin'. And then, you know, at night... (pauses) I think it was last Tuesday? Or was that the other way around? Anyway, I get this chest pain and tightness. Like when I'm doin' laundry and liftin' those heavy baskets... (chuckles) My grandkids always laugh at me for strugglin' with them. But anyway, like I said, it's in my chest. And then there's the smell and taste... (pauses again) I mean, we had some soup last night for supper and it was just... (shrugs) nothing. No flavor to it at all. Must've forgot how to make it right.""","Um, excuse me doc... (pauses) You know, I've been having this trouble with my nose, yeah? Can't breathe through it like I used to. It's all stuffy and congested, you know what I mean? (coughs) Ah, pardon me. Like a cold or something, but it won't go away.

And then there's these nights... (pauses, lost in thought) Oh boy, where was I going with this? Ah yes! Nights when I wake up and feel like my chest is all tight and achy. It's a funny feeling, hard to describe... (trails off)

You know what it reminds me of? That time I had the heart attack scare... (pauses, looking concerned) Wait, was that just last week or something? No, no, don't mind me... (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes! The chest tightness. It's not too bad most days, but it keeps me up at night. And then there's this other thing... (hesitates) Oh dear, how do you call it...? My taste and smell, they're gone. Can't taste my coffee or... or what was I saying? (laughs)

You know, I was just thinking about that nice piece of pie my wife used to make... the one with the cherry filling... (trails off) Oh dear, where's my mind going today?

Oh yes! My sense of smell and taste. Like a cold again, but it won't go away either. And this stuffy nose... I swear, I've been blowing my nose more times than I can count... (chuckles to herself)

Anyway, that's my problem... or at least I think that's what it is..."
54,allergy,I have asthma like symptoms like wheezing and difficulty breathing. I often get fever and have headaches. I feel tired all the time,"""Oh dear, doc... asthma-like symptoms, you see... wheezing, like that time I went to the mountains and got all dusty... (pauses) Oh wait, was it the mountains or the beach? Uh, anyway... difficulty breathing, like when I'm walking uphill. Fever, yes, fever... my wife, Mabel, she always says I get a cold after... umm... what's that thing called? You know, where you breathe in something and get sick? Ah yes! Flu! Or is it pneumonia? No matter, the point is I get this wheezy chest and can't catch my breath. And these headaches, dear me... they're like a knife through my head. Tired all the time, too... like when I was working on that garden, but even then I had to take breaks.""","Oh dearie me... I don't know if this is relevant, but I remember my grandmother used to make these wonderful apple pies... anyway... so, like you asked about my symptoms, and I think it's my asthma again, bless my heart... wheezing, yeah, that's what it is... wheezing and feeling all choked up. (pauses) You know, I was at the grocery store yesterday and they had these lovely strawberries on sale... (sighs)

Oh yes, breathing... it's just so hard to breathe sometimes. And my fever, well, it's not like a cold or flu, no sir... this is different. It's like... have you ever been in one of those sauna places? Where it feels like your whole body is on fire? (chuckles) No, never mind...

Headaches, oh boy... I get those too. And I don't know if it's related or not, but my husband has been complaining about the smell of gas coming from the furnace in our basement... (pauses, looks around the room) Where was I? Ah yes, headaches... they're just so dreadful. (sighs again)

Tired all the time... that's the worst part. I swear, I used to be able to walk for miles without getting winded, but now... (shrugs) it's like my batteries are running out of juice or something. (laughs softly)

I think I might have mentioned this before... no, wait, was it my sister who had asthma? (pauses, frowns) Oh dear, my mind is a jumble today..."
55,allergy,"I feel tired all the time, I have lost my taste and have a really sore throat. I also get feverish and often have muscle aches. Sometimes my whole body just cramps up","I don't know, doc, I feel so...tired all the time. Like, I used to get up at 5 am and do my daily exercises, but now just getting out of bed is a chore. And, um, my taste buds, they just...don't work no more. Can't even eat my favorite soup anymore. (pauses) You know, I was thinking about that recipe I used to make for the church potluck...such a hit! Anyway, sore throat's been killing me too. Been getting these feverish spells and, oh boy, the muscle aches...it feels like I've been run over by a truck. (chuckles) My grandkids always say I'm as spry as a spring chicken, but nope...my body just cramps up on me sometimes. What day is today, anyway?","(Background noise: static from a nearby TV, muffled sounds of household activity)

Oh boy, doc... I don't know if I can remember everything... (pauses) Ah yes! I'm so tired all the time now. Can't even make it through the day without wanting to take a nap. My friend Edna's cousin, you know, she had that same problem... or was it my sister? (laughs slightly) Oh dear, anyway...

Taste buds, they're gone, I swear! Nothing tastes like anything anymore. Even my coffee doesn't taste like coffee. And this throat... it's so sore, it's like someone poured acid in there. (pauses to take a breath) My neighbor's kid, he had a sore throat once, got better right away...

Feverish? Oh yes, that's the word! Gets me all hot and sweaty at night. Can't sleep, you know? And my muscles... achy, like someone hit 'em with a baseball bat. I try to remember when it started... (trails off) Wasn't it after I moved the garden beds around last spring? No, no, that's not right...

My whole body just cramps up sometimes... like this time yesterday, while watching TV. Cramped so bad I thought my legs were gonna snap! And my back... always hurts now. (pauses again) My doctor friend said something about inflammation... no, wait, it was arthritis... (chuckles) Oh dear me...

(TV static in the background continues for a few seconds before fading into the sound of household activity)

(Softly) Now, where was I? Ah yes! The fatigue... Can't even walk to the mailbox without needing a nap."
56,allergy,I have been experiencing a loss of appetite and have difficulty swallowing food. I have been suffering from sore throat and runnny nose also.,"Oh dear doctor... I think it's been about two weeks now, maybe longer? Time flies, you know. Anyway, I've just not had my appetite like usual. Food doesn't interest me no more. And swallowing, well, that's become quite a chore. (pauses) Reminds me of my husband's brother, Bob - or was it Bill? Always complaining about his throat, poor soul. Ah yes, sore throat, that's what I have too... can't swallow without wincing. Runny nose as well, been sniffling all morning... and, oh dear, I'm getting a bit muddled. What was the question again?","(sigh) Oh dear... I don't know if this is related but I've been having trouble with my appetite lately... (pauses) You know what's been on my mind? That time we went to the lake house, remember that trip? The one with the children? (chuckles) Good times... Now, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. It just doesn't feel right. Food tastes funny, or maybe it's just me... (hesitates) Hmm... 

Anyway, swallowing's been a problem too. Like trying to eat soup through a straw. Or that one time I had trouble with a glass of water... You know what I mean? (pauses again) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now... What was it about swallowing that's bothering me? (sighs)

Oh yes! My throat! It's been sore for weeks. And my nose, Lord have mercy, it's been running like a faucet. I've gone through an entire box of tissues in one day. (chuckles nervously) I'm starting to feel like I'm allergic to something... Or maybe it's the pollen? We did get some strange flowers blooming last spring... (trails off)

I just can't seem to catch my breath, either. Like someone's walking on my chest. It's all quite... uncomfortable. I hope it's not that one thing... You know, with my family history and all. (pauses once more) Oh dear me, what was the question again?"
57,allergy,"I feel fatigued all the time, and have a tingling sensation in my throat. I have also developed flaky skin. Sometimes I get puffy eyes and sometimes puffs up too.","You know, Doc, I'm so tired all the time... (pauses) Excuse me, where was I going this morning? Ah yes, fatigue. It's been weeks now. My throat, it feels like pins and needles, you know? Tingling sensation, yeah. And my skin, dear Lord, it's all flaky. Can't even get a decent night's sleep no more... (chuckles) Reminds me of when I was a young girl, staying with my aunt in the country. We'd sit on the porch for hours, watching the stars...

(pauses, looks around)

Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, puffy eyes. Sometimes they're all red and swollen, other times... well, you know how it is. And then there's this one time, my cousin Edna had a similar thing, I think she said it was allergies or something... (shrugs) Or was that Aunt Mabel? Anyway, it seems to come and go...","Oh dear... Doc... I'm so tired all the time... can't seem to catch my breath... (pauses) You know what I was just thinking about? My garden! My tomatoes are growing like crazy this year... (chuckles) Anyway, fatigue. Yeah, it's been going on for weeks now. Can't even make it through a whole episode of General Hospital without feeling like I'm gonna collapse... (sighs)

And then there's this tingling in my throat. It's like someone's playing a piano inside me and I can feel the keys vibrating against the back of my tongue... (taps on her throat) Oh, I wish I had one of those contraptions that shows you your insides... You know, like them old X-rays? (gets sidetracked) Did I ever tell you about the time I got a polio shot as a kid? My arm swelled up like a balloon... (laughs)

Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, flaky skin! It's all over my body now – arms, legs, even my elbows. And don't even get me started on these puffy eyes... Sometimes they're so swollen, I look like the Elephant Man... (giggles) Not that I'm complaining or anything. My sister used to say I looked good with big eyes. ""It's cute, dear,"" she'd say.

Now, let me think for a sec... (pauses) Where did I put my glasses? Ah yes! And this puffiness – sometimes it hits me out of nowhere and other times it just sorta lingers. Like the weather in Florida – unpredictable, you know?"
58,allergy,"I have stomach cramps, nausea and diarrhea. My throat is swollen, and I have difficulty breathing. Sometimes at night night I get chest pain and nauseous.","Oh dearie me... I have these stomach cramps, you know? Been getting 'em for days now. And then there's this nausea, makes me feel all queasy inside. And don't even get me started on the diarrhea... (chuckles) Reminds me of that time at the picnic last summer... 

Anyway... my throat is all swollen like a red apple, and breathing's become quite a chore. I swear, it's like trying to breathe through a straw! At night, I get these chest pains... think it's around midnight? Or was it Tuesday? (laughs) Oh dear, that's not important now.

Sometimes, when I'm lying in bed, I feel this... this nausea creeping up on me. And my heart starts racing like it's doing the cha-cha-slide! (chuckles to herself)","I'm not sure if I should be here... (pauses) Ah, yes... my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Stomach cramps, that's what it is. (coughs) Excuse me. Nausea too. And diarrhea. Oh boy, don't even get me started on the bathroom habits lately. (chuckles weakly) Not exactly how I envisioned my golden years.

Throat's been swollen, feels like someone's stuffed a balloon in there. Trouble breathin', that's what it is. Can't catch my breath no more... (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, where was I? Ah yes, breathing difficulties... I swear I took an aspirin yesterday for my arthritis and now my throat's all puffy like a squirrel's nest.

(suddenly changes subject) Did I tell you about the time I went fishin' with Jimmy in '62? Caught us a whopper of a bass. (chuckles warmly) Oh, boy... those were the days...

(clears throat) Where was I? Ah yes, chest pains at night. Can't sleep for thinkin' it's gonna give out on me like my old Pontiac did last year. Nausea too... (pauses to collect thoughts) Sometimes in the middle of the night, I feel this... this heavy sensation on my chest. Not sure what it means. Maybe I just ate too much beans and bacon...

(faltering) You know, I think I might've already told you all this... Did I?"
59,allergy,I have itchy and red skin. Sometimes these result in flaking. My face and lips puff up and causes a lot of inconvinience. I get watery eyes sometimes and headches when the puffing gets severe,"You know, doc... my skin, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately... Itchy and red, like I've been rubbin' myself with sandpaper or somethin'. And these little flakes... (chuckles) reminds me of when I used to have that silly cat, Snowy. She'd get those flaky skin things on her paws... anyway...

Where was I? Ah yes, my skin! It's all red and itchy. My face and lips, they puff up somethin' awful. Can't even eat a nice bowl of chicken soup without thinkin' about how much I wanna scratch 'em some more... (pauses) Wait, which day did the doc say I was supposed to come in for this appointment? Was it Tuesday or Wednesday?

Oh dear me... and them watery eyes! Lord have mercy. I look like I've been cryin' all night long. And headaches... goodness gracious, they're so dreadful when my face is all puffed up somethin' fierce. (giggles) You know, I once had a headache that lasted for three days straight. Wasn't pleasant, let me tell you...","I'm so sorry, Doc... I've been gettin' these itchy patches on my skin, ya know? Can't seem to shake 'em off. They're all red and stuff, like when I was out in the sun too long. Flakin' is what happens next, if I remember right. (pauses) Did we have that chicken soup for lunch yesterday? Or was it Tuesday?

Oh dear, my face... (chuckles) It gets all puffy and inflamed, just like when I ate too much bread. Can't even eat a sandwich without gettin' an ache in the stomach, nowadays. My lips do this too, swell up like a balloon. Lord have mercy...

My eyes get so watery sometimes, like rainin' inside my head. (laughs) Not exactly what I need right now! And when that puffiness gets bad, oh boy... headaches, you know? Like someone's pokin' me in the forehead with a pin. Can't even think straight. Now, where did I put those reading glasses?

Uh-oh, I almost forgot... (distracted) Did I tell ya about the time I saw that bee fly into our kitchen? Stuck itself to the sugar jar! My goodness gracious... anyway... so yeah, my skin issues and headaches. Must've been goin' on for months now. You know how it is when you're older: all sorts of nonsense happens with the body.

My eyes, they get all scratchy... you know, like when you're tryin' to read small print and your eyes just won't focus? Like that. And then they start runnin', too!

Wait, where's my tea? (pauses) Ah yes, the cough. It's always there, like a gentle companion or somethin'. (chuckles) My head... oh dear, it's been achin' for days now. I think maybe it's those new pillows I got. No, no, that can't be right... (trails off) My wife, Edna, she used to have this real bad cough when we were first married... (pauses, lost in thought) We went on a trip to the beach once and...

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, my head. It's just always there, like a dull drumbeat or somethin'. Never goes away, even when I sleep.

(gestures to face) lips and around my eyes get all puffy like I had that... uh, bee sting thing once. You know? (chuckles) I got stung by a bee when I was little.

(starts rambling) My grandmother used to make me this tea... no, it wasn't for sneezing, but for my cough. She said it would help. Don't remember what was in it now, though. Something with honey and lemon, I think? (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes! Sneezing and swelling and sore throat. Once I start... (starts to laugh) you know when you get one of those... uh, what's the word... ah! Coughing fits like that time I went to the lake with my kids. My daughter got a cold and I caught it from her. Yeah, something like that.

( returns to the original topic) Anyway, I sneeze nonstop, can't stop sneezing even when I'm in the bathroom. (chuckles nervously) Don't know what's going on... or maybe I do? Hmmph."
62,allergy,"I have trouble breathing and get short of breath. I have a dry, hacking cough, itchy eyes, and swelling all over my face and body.","Doc... I gotta tell ya, breathing gets harder lately... (pauses) You know, my sister Edna, she had trouble breathing too, back in '92... or was it '95? Shoot, I always get those years mixed up... anyway... (coughs) Excuse me. This dry cough is driving me crazy! Can't stop it no matter how much water I drink... and my eyes, oh boy, they're all itchy today. Like someone poured sand in 'em. (chuckles) My granddaughter said I looked like a raccoon! (laughs) Swelling, too... got it on my face, arms, legs... everywhere. I swear, I look like the Michelin Man now.","Wait a minute, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, my breathing... (pauses) You know, I was at the early bird special last night, and they had them fancy deviled eggs. Reminded me of my wife's cookin'. She used to make 'em for our anniversary dinner... (trails off) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, breathin'.

Now, like I said, it's gettin' hard to breathe sometimes. Makes me feel all tired and... (hesitates) and what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Oh dear, it'll come to me in a minute... (pauses again) Shortness of breath, that's it! Yeah, like when you're walkin' uphill and you can't catch your wind. That's what it feels like.

And then there's this cough... Dry, hacking thing. Like my grandkid had last year with the bronchitis. He was coughin' up a storm... (gets sidetracked) You know, I shoulda gotten him that new humidifier for his birthday. Think he'd still appreciate it...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the cough and eyes. They get all itchy and... (pauses once more) and watery. Like when you're out in the rain too long. My niece used to have problems like that when she was a kid.

And finally – or maybe it's at the start now... (laughs) I'm gettin' mixed up – my face and body, they swell all up. Makes me look like a chipmunk... (chuckles) Oh dear, I hope you can see past the... (trails off)

You know what might be good for this? That nice tea I have in my cupboard. Has some ginger or somethin'..."
63,allergy,I have a plugged nose and nasal congestion. I occasionally have stiffness and chest discomfort at night. I've also lost my ability to taste and smell.,"You know, doc... (pauses) Oh boy, I was trying to make myself a sandwich for lunch yesterday and... (chuckles) Anyway... My nose is all plugged up, like a faucet that won't turn off. Can't breathe through it, ya know? And my sinuses are acting up too - congestion, that's what the young folks call it these days, I think. (pauses again) Oh dear, now where did I put my reading glasses... Now, about this chest stuff... sometimes at night, especially after dinner, I get this stiffness in my chest. It's like... well, you know how it feels when you've been out mowing the lawn all day? Like that. (pauses once more) Oh yes, and the taste and smell, they're just gone. Completely gone. Can't even tell the difference between sugar and salt no more...","I'm so glad you're here to see me... my name's Edna, by the way... anyway... I've got this plugged nose, you know? It's been like that for weeks now. Can't breathe out of it, poor thing. And my sinuses, they're all congested too. My daughter-in-law, she said maybe it's allergies or something. But I don't think so. I'm not allergic to anything... unless it's dust mites? (pauses) Wait, what was the question again?

Oh yes, my nose! So, as I was saying, it's just a real problem. And then at night, oh dear, I get this stiffness in my chest. Like someone's sitting on me or something. (chuckles) My husband used to have that too... or did he? Ah, anyway... and the pain, it's a bit of a sharpness. Not too bad, but enough to keep me up.

But the worst part is, I lost my sense of taste! Can you imagine? Food tastes like cardboard now. (shudders) And smell, oh boy! It's just gone. I couldn't even tell if it was raining outside yesterday... or last week... or whenever. (laughs nervously) You know how it is when you get older and things start to slip away...

Now, where did I put my list of medications? (pauses, looks around the room) Oh dear, not again! Um, what were we talking about again?"
64,allergy,"I get symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing and breathing problems. I frequently have headaches and fever. All the time, I feel exhausted.","Doc... (pauses) excuse me, was that last week we talked about my medication? (chuckles) Anyway... I get these asthma symptoms, wheezing and breathing problems like a dog, you know? Can't catch my breath no matter what. And them headaches, boy... they're a doozy. One day it's this side, the next it's that side. Fever, too... can't seem to shake it off. I swear, I saw that new bakery downtown has the most wonderful scones... (trails off) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, exhaustion. That's my main complaint now. All the time, feel like runnin' out of gas or somethin'.","Oh boy, doc... (pauses) You know, I had a nice cup of tea this morning... (chuckles) Anyway, about my symptoms... (pauses again) I get these wheezing sounds, you know, when I breathe in? Like a whistle, almost. And sometimes it's really hard to catch my breath. (hesitates) Now, where was I? Oh yes, breathing problems... and headaches. Lord have mercy, those are the worst. (pauses once more)

Fever, too. Just the other day, I think it was Tuesday... or was that Wednesday? (chuckles nervously) Time gets away from me. Anyway, fever's been a problem for weeks now. And then there's this exhaustion... (sighs) I'm tired all the time. Can't seem to shake it off no matter what I do. (trails off)

You know, I was thinking about my aunt Edna... she used to have asthma too... (pauses, lost in thought) Now, where did I put that recipe for her famous goulash? Ah yes, the symptoms... (clears throat) As I was saying... these headaches and fever, they're just getting worse. And don't even get me started on the breathing... (fidgets in seat) It's like my lungs are working overtime or something.

( mutters to herself ) Now, what's that other thing I had today? Oh yes, medication. My neighbor gave me some pills for arthritis... but they didn't help with this breathing business..."
65,allergy,"I always feel exhausted, have bad taste, and have an extremely scratchy throat. I also have muscular pain and heat. My entire body simply cramps up occasionally.","You know, I always feel so... exhausted, no matter what I do. Can't seem to shake this tiredness off. And my taste buds, well, they're just not right. Everything tastes bitter or metallic. My mouth feels like it's got a bad coat of paint on the tongue. (pauses) Oh, Edna was telling me about her new recipe for lemon bars... anyway...

And then there's this scratchy throat business. It's been going on for weeks now, I'm sure of it. I could swear it started last month? Or maybe it was the month before that? (chuckles) Lord have mercy, I get those two mixed up all the time.

Muscle pain and heat, you see... my entire body cramps up from time to time. Can't even lift my grandkids without getting these shooting pains down my arm. And it's not just my arms, mind you. (pauses) Did I tell you about my cousin's grandson? He's a fine young man...","(Background noise of a busy doctor's office in the distance)

Oh dear, doc... (pauses) I don't know if this is related or not, but my sister's cousin had something similar once... Anyway... (chuckles) I'm always so tired, just plumb exhausted. Can't even get outta bed some days. And my taste buds? Fuhgeddaboutit! Bad as can be. Like someone poured sugar on 'em and then... (pauses again) Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the bad taste. Must've been eatin' that same old soup for lunch every day. No wonder!

And this scratchy throat of mine? Lord have mercy... it's like sandpaper! I swear, I can feel it all the way down to my... (hesitates) what's that thing called? You know, where your lungs are? Ah yes, my lungs! And they're aching too. Just got back from the store and bought some of those cough drops. Gonna try 'em tonight. Maybe that'll help.

Now, let me think on this... (pauses, looks around the room) Did I tell you about my grandson's birthday party? We had it last weekend. (smiling) He's gettin' so big! Okay, focus... (clears throat) Ah yes, muscular pain and heat. That's what it is! And them cramps... (exasperated sigh) My entire body just seizes up sometimes. Like I'm having a heart attack or somethin'! Can't even walk across the room without wincin'. ( Looks down, lost in thought for a moment)

Oh dear, I hope that's all relevant... (nervously chuckles again)"
66,allergy,"I've been losing my appetite, and I also have trouble swallowing. My nose has been running, and I have a sore throat.","Doc... I don't know if it's just me gettin' older, but I've been feelin' pretty down lately. Losin' my appetite, ya know? Can't stomach nothin', not even breakfast cereal. And then there's this trouble swallower thing... (pauses) You know that new restaurant downtown? Had lunch there last week, great soup... anyway... where was I? Ah yes! Swallowing. It's like food's gettin' stuck in my throat. My doctor friend, Dr... uh... what's-his-name... (chuckles) Oh, it'll come to me! Anyway, this sore throat of mine's been a nuisance. And let me tell ya, I've had the sniffles somethin' awful lately - nose runnin' like a faucet...","I don't know if you'll believe me, but I've been feelin' quite off lately... You see, my granddaughter was just here visitin', and she brought me them cookies from that bakery downtown. I love those cookies, but I haven't been enjoyin' 'em like I used to... No, wait, what was it I was tellin' you about? Ah yes! My appetite's gone south. Can't seem to stomach nothin'. (pauses) Now, where did I put that TV remote?

Oh dear, I remember now. And this swallowin' business... It's like somethin's stuck in my throat. Must be them old bones of mine, gettin' all creaky and whatnot. You know how it is when you're gettin' on in years? (chuckles) My sister used to have that problem too... or was it my cousin? No matter, it's not important.

( mutters to herself ) Running nose... Always seems to be runnin' this time of year. Must be the allergies or somethin'. I swear, I'm startin' to sound like a faucet! (laughs) And now you're makin' me think about my sister's husband... such a fine gentleman... but where was I? Ah yes!

Sore throat, that's right. Been goin' on for days now. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I turn off the stove? I could've sworn I turned it off... Anyway... this sore throat of mine is just the most nuisance. Don't know what to do 'bout it. You'd better have some of them throat lozenges on hand... or maybe I can just have a nice cup of tea instead?"
67,allergy,I'm always worn out and experiencing a tingle in my throat. I've also started to have dry skin. My eyes occasionally swell up,"Oh dearie me... I'm just so tired all the time, Doctor... (pauses) You know, I was at the Early Bird Special last week and I saw my friend Agnes, or is it Annie? Anyway... (chuckles) Ah yes, my throat. It's got this tingling sensation all the time. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it's like when you get a sunburn and your skin feels funny. Speaks of dry skin, I've been noticing that too... My hands feel like parchment paper! (laughs) And these swelled eyes... don't know what to make of 'em. Used to be just under my left eye, now they seem to go both ways... or is it the right? Hmm... (trails off)","I'm so tired all the time... (pauses) I don't know what's wrong with me. Worn out, that's the word. Like my batteries are dead or something. (chuckles) You know, like those old radios we used to have? No, no, not radios... (trails off)

Anyway, this tingling in my throat... it's like a buzzing. Yeah, buzzing is the right word. Like when you put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and feel that funny feeling? (pauses) Oh dear, where was I going with this?

Oh yes! My skin. It's so dry. Dry as the Sahara desert, my daughter says. (laughs) She always makes these jokes... (stops suddenly)

You know what's really been bothering me lately is these big ol' bags under my eyes. They look like I've been crying for weeks, but I haven't! I'm a strong woman, you know? (pauses to think) Wait, where did I put that tea towel? Ah yes... the swelling in my eyes. That's what I was trying to tell you.

I don't know if it's related, but I also have this... this... (struggling to find the word) dryness. Everywhere! My skin, my throat... maybe even my joints or something? (confused) No, no, that's not right... (trails off again)

Anyway... like I said, I'm just so tired all the time. (sighs) Maybe it's the medication for my arthritis? Or was that my blood pressure? Oh dear... (laughs nervously)"
68,allergy,"I feel queasy, nauseous, and dizzy. I have a swelling throat and am having breathing issues. I occasionally have chest discomfort and nausea at night.","You know, Doc... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all jumbled up here... (chuckles) Ah yes, my symptoms! So, I've been feelin' a bit... queasy-like. Nauseous, that's the word. Like when I went to the restaurant last week and had that new-fangled soup. (pauses again) Not sure what it was called, but it didn't agree with me one bit! (laughs nervously)

Now, where was I? Ah yes... dizziness. It comes on out of nowhere! (gulps) And my throat's been swellin' up something fierce. Makes it hard to breathe, you know? Like when Jimmy Wilson came over and started talkin' about his garden. (pauses once more) I swear, that man talks longer than my late husband... anyway!

(pauses again)

Oh dear, what else did I have on the list? Ah yes! Chest discomfort at night. And sometimes in the day too, but you know how it is, Doc... (hesitates) What was the name of that new med I'm takin'? The one with the pills that are too big for me to swallow...","I don't know if it's just my age, but I feel all wobbly, like my knees are made of jelly. Queasy, nauseous... you know, like that time we went on the rollercoaster at the fair? My wife loved those rides, always laughing and holding her hands up high... anyway... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I?

Oh yes, queasy. And dizzy. Like when I got out of bed this morning and felt all lightheaded. Must've had too much coffee again. I swear, my stomach's been growling like a bear all day. Swelling throat, you see... (pauses to scratch her neck) Ah, there it is. Just under the Adam's apple. And breathing issues, yes... can't catch my breath when I walk up stairs or even talk too much. Frightening.

Now, where did I put that folder? Uh-oh... I was looking for the recipe book and now I think I need a... (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, chest discomfort! Yes, at night mostly. And nausea... especially if I eat too much cabbage or Brussels sprouts. Too many vegetables, just like my mother used to say. Ugh... (exhales) Oh dear, where's my tea?

Must have left it in the living room with my reading glasses. Can't find anything anymore. Always losing things... you know how that is? I'll get my grandkids to help me clean when they come over this weekend..."
69,allergy,"My skin is red and scratchy. These can occasionally flake. My cheeks and lips swell, which is really annoying. I occasionally have headaches and runny eyes because to the puffing.","You know, Doc... my skin's been like this for a while now. It's all red and scratchy, if you can imagine that. And sometimes, not always, but sometimes these little flakes come off. My cheeks and lips, they puff up something awful. Can't even eat my favorite chili anymore without getting some juice on my shirt... or was it last week? Anyway... so the swelling's a nuisance, no question about it.

Now, my headaches aren't too bad, but I get 'em often enough. And then there are these runny eyes... must be from the puffing, like you said. Or is that what they called it at first? Ah, don't mind me, just get on with it, please!","I don't know if I'm makin' a big deal out of this, but... (pauses) My skin, you see, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. It's all red and scratchy, like when I got that rash from the new laundry detergent last year, remember that? (chuckles) No, wait, that was my granddaughter's issue... (trails off) 

Anyway, it flakes sometimes, which is a bother. And then there are these swellings on my cheeks and lips, ugh! They puff right up like I've been eatin' too many beans or somethin'. (laughs) My late husband used to say that was just from the heat, but I think it's more than that. 

And another thing... (pauses again) what was I talkin' about? Oh yes! The headaches! They're awful, and I get 'em whenever this puffing business is goin' on. And then my eyes get all runny, like when I was a little girl and we'd cry after eatin' too much sugar. (giggles) My mother would say it was just the tears from the sugar... (stops suddenly)

I swear, it's like my body's decidin' to give me a bit of trouble these days. The doc said somethin' about an allergy, but I'm not so sure... maybe it's just gettin' old? You know how it is when you're feelin' under the weather and your brain's all muddled up? (laughs softly) I'm gettin' on in years, might as well be comfortable, right?"
70,allergy,"I frequently sneeze, and my nose runs. I constantly cough, and my eyes are sore and watery. My head hurts all the time.","(sigh) Oh dearie me... I get these sneezes comin' on outta nowhere, and my nose just starts runnin' like a faucet, can't stop it... (pauses to collect thoughts) You know, just like that time I was at the park with the grandkids, and they were playin' tag, and I got all wet from splashin' in the puddles. (chuckles) Ah, but anyway...

I'm always coughin', and my eyes feel all... sore and watery, it's a right nuisance. (pauses to scratch arm) What was I sayin'? Oh yes, my head, it hurts all the time, like a dull ache, you know? Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I think it might've been after that... that... uh, what was the name of that new medication I'm takin' for my blood pressure?

When I was a girl, we'd take walks in the park and there were those big trees with... uh, what do you call 'em? Ah yes! Weeds! And pollen everywhere. (chuckles) Anyway...

Sneezes, all the time. Can't catch my breath sometimes. Nose runs like a faucet, I swear. Need to get some of that nose spray stuff. You know, like they have at the pharmacy... (trails off) What was I saying?

Oh yes! Coughing too. Constant coughing. Like my cat, Whiskers. Always coughing up hairballs. (laughs) Poor thing. And my eyes... well, they water something awful. Can't even watch TV without gettin' all teary-eyed.

Now, let me think about this... (pauses, looks away) Headaches, too. All the time. Can't remember what I had for breakfast, but I'm sure it's related to these headaches... (chuckles nervously)

Coughs some more when I talk. Like now! Ugh, excuse me. Where was I? Oh yes! My head hurts all... (pauses again) What's the word I'm thinking of? Starts with a ""t"", I think. Tired? No, that's not it. Throbbing? Is that what you folks call it?

Anyway, these symptoms. I just want to feel better. Make this old body work like it used to... (sighs) What time is it?"

I just can't stop sneezing once I get going.,"Doc... you know what they say, ""April showers bring May flowers""... anyway, my throat hurts somethin' awful. Always sneezin', can't stop no matter how hard I try. (pauses) You remind me of my cousin Harold, he was a doctor too... or was it his brother? Anyway, point is, this sore throat's been botherin' me for days now.

And then there's this swellin' around my eyes and lips. Makes me look like a balloon, if you know what I mean. (chuckles) Can't even remember the last time I sneezed just once without gettin' another one right after... it's like my body's decided to play a trick on me.

(whispers) Now, let me think, when did I first notice this sneezin'? Was it Monday or Tuesday? No matter, it's been goin' on for too long now. You see what I mean, Doc? (sighs)","I'm so glad you're here, doc... (pauses) Oh boy, I was just makin' some dinner, and I started thinkin' about that time my cousin Edna had a sore throat, just like mine...

Lord have mercy, they're like nothin' I've ever had before. Once I start, I just can't stop... (stares off) Did I tell you about the time I accidentally locked myself out of the house? (laughs)

Anyway, back to this sore throat and sneezin'. Sometimes my eyes get all itchy, especially around the corners, and my lips swell up like sausages. (pauses) You know what would be nice right now? A nice cup of tea... or was it coffee? No, I think it's tea... anyway, like I said, my throat's been sore for days, and these sneezes are just gettin' worse. I'll go ahead and write that down for you... (pauses) What's that thingamajig on your desk? Is that a new pen? (stares at the pen) Oh dear, I'm sorry about this...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my sneezin'. Like I said, once it starts, I just can't stop. Sometimes I'll go hours without sneezin', and then suddenly... pow! It's like a dam burstin' or somethin'... (laughs) What am I talkin' about now?"

And this cough... dry as the Sahara desert! It's like my throat's on fire. Hacking away like a chain saw. (clears throat) Excuse me... anyway, it's been goin' on for weeks now. Weeks! My knees hurt somethin' awful, too. I think it's just from standin' up to get the mail... or was that the ice cream? We had ice cream last week, didn't we?

Like after you eat that spicy food and it's all over? Well, I've been feelin' like that for weeks now! Can't even tell if my soup is salty or not... (laughs)

You know what's funny? My grandmother used to say... (pauses) what was it again? Oh yes! That a good sniffle cures everything! (chuckles) Ah, those were the days...

Feelin' so... worn out all the time. Can't even mow the lawn no more, and my garden's sufferin' for it, too! My wife says I should just hire someone, but that's not how we were raised, no sirree... (trails off)

Anyway... (pauses) I think that's it. That's what's been goin' on with me lately. Do you have any of those throat lozenges?"
75,allergy,"I always feel worn out, have unpleasant taste in my mouth, and have a really itchy throat. My muscles are also hot and hurting. Sometimes my whole body just cramps up.","You know, doc... I always feel like I'm runnin' on empty, ya know? Worn out, that is. My mouth feels funny, not right, if you catch my drift. Taste buds are playin' up, unpleasant, y'know what I mean? And this throat of mine, Lord have mercy, it's itchier than a hound dog in July! (pauses) Now, where was I? Oh yeah... My muscles, they're all hot and achy. Like someone's been stumblin' around with a sledgehammer inside me. Sometimes my whole body just... cramps up on me, like it's got a mind of its own. (chuckles slightly) Reminds me of that time I was gardenin', and my back went out on me...","I don't know if this is what I've been feeling all along... You know, my back's been acting up something awful... Can you believe how expensive groceries are these days? (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my back! Anyway, it's just been so... tired. Like I'm always exhausted, even after sleeping in till noon.

Now, what was the other thing? (thinks for a moment) My mouth's been tasting like... well, you know when you've had too much coffee? That bitter taste, yeah... It's been doing that all the time lately. And my throat... it's just so itchy! Reminds me of that one time I was at the beach and got sunburned real bad on my neck.

(Chuckles) Oh boy, your nurse is really cute, you know? (laughs to herself) Where was I again? Ah yes, muscles. Mine've been all hot and achy. It's like they're on fire or something! And sometimes... (hesitates) I don't know if this sounds silly, but sometimes my whole body just cramps up. Like my back and legs get real stiff and it takes me hours to relax again.

(Starts to ramble) Did you know that the first television show was The Queen's Messenger? My sister used to watch it all the time... (pauses again) Oh dear, what I'm trying to say is, this cramping business really gets me down. Maybe it's just age or something..."
76,allergy,"Along with losing my appetite, I've been having swallowing issues. I have a sore throat, and my nose has been running.","Doc... I don't know if this is important or not, but I've been having some trouble eatin'. Lost my appetite, you see. Haven't felt like cookin' nothin' in weeks now. My granddaughter came over last week, and she made me that nice chicken soup, but even that didn't sound good to me... I mean, it usually does.

But, anyway, along with not wantin' to eat, I've been havin' some trouble swallowerin'. It's like somethin's stuck in my throat. And it hurts a little bit too. My sore throat, that's what I call it... (pauses) Now, where did I put those pain relievers? Ah yes, the bathroom cabinet.

And to top it all off, my nose has been runnin' somethin' fierce! Clogged up like a faucet... (chuckles) Just like when we had that plumbing issue at the house last year. What was his name, Joe or John? Anyway, I digress...","I don't know if I'm doing this right, sorry dear... uh, my appetite's been gone for weeks now, can't even think about food no more... or is it months? Wait, what was that date again? (pauses) Oh yes, the 15th... or was it the 17th? Anyway, it's not like I'm hungry, just... well, you know. My stomach's been growling, but at nothing in particular. Like a wild animal or something.

And now my swallowing... dear me, it's getting worse by the day! (chuckles) No, no, I mean that's not funny at all. It's scary, really. I try to drink water, and then suddenly, uh, how did I put this? Ah yes, the liquid decides to go down the wrong way. You know, like when you're trying to catch a slippery fish with your bare hands? (laughs nervously) Oh dear... where was I?

Oh, my throat! It's been killing me, literally. Sore, burning sensation all the time. And then there's this runny nose... (taps nose) not just one nostril, mind you, both of 'em are at it full-time now! Sniffling away like a little baby. Can't even watch my favorite TV shows without a box of tissues nearby. Or was that the cat? I swear I had to clean up after Whiskers once more than usual... (sighs)

Nose and throat... what's the connection again, doctor? Ah yes, don't worry about me, I'm just... uh, you know. Can't remember the word for it, something with a 'th' sound..."
77,allergy,I always feel exhausted and have a tickle in my throat. My skin has also started to feel dry. I occasionally get ocular swelling.,"""Ah, doc... I'm so tired all the time. Just can't seem to get out of bed in the mornin'. Felt this tickle in my throat for weeks now, must've been since that last cold we had at the church potluck... or was it the one before? Anyway, skin's as dry as the Sahara desert, I swear. Can't even use a nice moisturizer like I used to. And then there's these swellings under me eyes... I think it started after I ate that spicy soup my granddaughter made... no, wait, was that last week or the week before? Ah, bother it all! Where was I? Oh yes, the swelling. It comes and goes, but it's quite uncomfortable.""

(Pauses to take a deep breath)

""You know, I remember when my mother used to get those swellings too... she'd put some cream on 'em, or so I'm told. My mind's as foggy as the morning dew these days... what was that thing again? Ah, yes! And this fatigue business... it's just wearin' me down somethin' fierce...""","I don't know what's goin' on with me... (pauses) I mean, I just feel so... tired all the time. Can't even get outta bed without feelin' like I'm draggin' a weight behind me. (trails off) My daughter-in-law was over yesterday and she made this lovely lasagna... (starts to hum) Anyway...

Oh yes, my throat. It's all tickly and itchy. Sometimes I cough in the middle of the night, and it wakes up my husband, poor man. He's always grumblin' about me snorin', but I'm like ""I'm not snorin', dear, I'm just... (pauses) ...coughin'. (chuckles)

Now, about this skin... (scratches arm) It feels like sandpaper, I swear. Always gets all dry and itchy. I use them creams and lotions, but they don't seem to do much good anymore. Used to be, my sister would give me these wonderful homemade scrubs... (gets lost in thought) Where's my tea? Did I leave it in the kitchen?

And then there's this... (stunned expression) ...my eyes! Oh dear Lord, sometimes they swell up like balloons and I look like a raccoon. My grandkids always laughin' at me, sayin', ""Look at Grandma's face!"" (giggles)

 Wait, what was the question? Ah yes... symptoms! That's it. So, as I said, exhaustion, tickly throat, dry skin, and these ocular swellings... (trails off) Did I take my medication today?"
78,allergy,"I'm dizzy, nauseated, and shaky. I'm having trouble breathing since my throat is swollen. On occasion, throughout the night, my chest hurts and I feel sick.","I'm all dizzy and stuff... (pauses) You know, I was at the early bird special yesterday, had a nice plate of chicken parmesan... anyway... (coughs) My throat's been swollen since... umm... Monday? Tuesday? Can't rightly remember now. Anyway, it's been acting up something fierce. Trouble breathing, you see... chest hurts when I breathe in deep. On occasion, at night... not always, mind you... my chest feels tight and I get these... (pauses) what do you call 'em? Ah yes, palpitations! Felt funny last night, thought maybe it was the cat, Mr. Whiskers, making a ruckus on the bed... no, wait, that's not it at all... anyway... I also feel sick to my stomach... (hesitates)","I'm dizzy... you know what I mean? Dizzy, like when I got that spinning thing... vertigo, I think the doctor said. And nauseated, oh dear, I was at the diner for breakfast yesterday, and they give me these pancakes with syrup, too much sugar, I shoulda known better... anyway...

And my arms are shaking like a leaf! (chuckles) You know how it is when you're cold, and your hands shake? Yeah, that's what it feels like. Now, now, let me think for a sec... what was I saying? Ah yes, the dizziness. It's been going on all morning, but yesterday evening too. I remember walking to the mailbox and feeling like I was gonna fall over.

My throat is so sore... it hurts to swallow. (pauses) Where did I put that aspirin? Ugh, never mind. Anyway, breathing's hard work now. My chest feels heavy, and my heart's racing. Wait, what were we talking about again? Oh right, the dizziness. It gets worse at night. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the... what was it called again? Ah yes! The wee hours! (laughs) And that's when this hurt starts in my chest. You know how sometimes you just feel... sick to your stomach? Yeah, like that. Not too bad, but it lingers. Now, what were we discussing here?"
79,allergy,"My skin is irritated and inflamed. Sometimes, they can flake. My lips and cheeks expand, and it is really unpleasant. Because of the puffing, I occasionally have headaches and wet eyes.","My skin, you see... it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Irritated and inflamed, I'd say. The doc at the clinic said it might be eczema? I think that's what he said. Anyway, sometimes these little flakes come out on my arms and legs. My lips, they puff right up like a balloon. Can't even eat without gettin' sauce all over 'em. Oh dear, my mind's racin', now where did I put them new reading glasses...? Ah yes! So, my cheeks too. And it's just so... unpleasant. All puffed up and red. Gives me these headaches somethin' awful. And don't even get me started on the tears. Wet eyes, all day long. My goodness, now where did I put my tea?","Oh dearie me, doc... or is it nurse? Hmm, I always get those two mixed up. Anyway... my skin, you see, it gets all irritated and inflamed like. Red and sore, it is. And then sometimes, oh dear, they flake off, just like that. Like dandruff, but not on my scalp, of course. No, no... (pauses to think) Now, where was I? Ah yes, the skin. Well, it gets all puffy too, my lips and cheeks, all swelled up like a balloon. Not pleasant at all, if you know what I mean.

Now, let me think on this for a moment... (trails off) Did I remember to feed the cat today? No, no, of course not. You can't feed a cat in a doctor's office. Unless it's a vet visit, but that's different... (chuckles)

Oh, yes! The headaches! And my eyes get all wet too, like tears. Not from crying or anything, just... you know, just watery. (pauses again) Now, I'm sure I had this problem when I was younger, must have been in the war... no, wait, that was something else. My sister's husband had it during the war... (trails off)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes! The skin thing. It's just not right, is it? And these headaches, they're getting worse, if you ask me. Now, what were we talking about again? (laughs)"

So, I've been having these awful sneezes and runny nose. My eyes are all watery too, and they hurt something fierce. Can't even watch TV without getting a sniffle... And then there's the coughing, it's constant. My head aches all the time now... (chuckles) Just like when I used to have those headaches from playing tennis back in my youth. Uh, what was I saying? Ah yes, the pain in my head.""","I'm tellin' ya, doc... my nose runs somethin' fierce, and I sneeze so much I think I've gotten through half a box of tissues already this week... (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden? My tomatoes are doin' great this season... anyway...

My eyes, they get all wet and hurt, like someone's put somethin' in 'em that don't belong there. And I'm coughin', oh boy, it's like nothin's changin' with this... (pauses) Wait, what was the name of that medicine my brother took for his... uh...

Headache, that's it! Yeah, my head aches somethin' awful all the time now. (pauses) You know, I had one just like that when I was younger. We used to call 'em ""pressure headaches"" or something... but I don't rightly remember what we did for 'em... (chuckles)

It's gettin' so, my sinuses feel all clogged up, and it hurts to move my face. Like someone took a big ol' hammer to my head. And my nose... like I said, it just won't stop runnin'. All this sneezin' is makin' me tired too... but when I try to rest, my eyes get all watery... (sighs) Ah...

Now where was I? Oh yeah, so all these symptoms just sorta piled up on top of each other. I swear, it's been weeks now. Could be the pollen, maybe allergies or somethin'... (stares off into space) Did I ever tell you about that summer we went fishin'? What a mess that was..."

(chuckles) don't know why that makes me think of it now... anyway. So these swelled-ups happen sometimes, not always together, you know? Like my sister's birthday party, she got upset with me for sayin' her name wrong... uh, what was I saying? Ah yes! The sneezin', it starts and just won't quit. Like when I'm in the car and someone doesn't wear their seatbelt, it gets stuck and you gotta force it off... (pauses) wait, where was I?""","I'm gettin' all these sneezes, doc... (pauses) Oh boy, I remember when my grandson had one of those pet goldfish... (chuckles) Anyway... My throat's been achin', and I don't know why. It hurts somethin' awful when I swallow. Sneezin's been happenin' a lot more often than usual, too. Can't seem to stop it once it starts. (pauses again)

And my lips... well, they swell up sometimes, and it looks like one of those bagel things on the side of my face. (laughs) I swear, my wife used to make me eat those when we'd have breakfast at the early bird special. You know what I'm sayin'? My eyes get all puffy too... but just a little bit, not like my cousin's allergies did that one time in Florida.

Wait, now where was I? Ah yes! Sneezes! Can't stop sneezin' once it starts. And this sore throat... don't know what's causin' it. (stammers) Oh dear, is it too early for lunchtime already? My wife said she'd bring me soup, but then the phone rang, and I was thinkin' about the neighbor's cat...

Oh dearie me! What was I sayin'? Ah yes... I'm gettin' these sneezes, like clockwork. (laughs) Clockwork! Reminds me of that other thing... uh... you know? The thing my wife got for our anniversary... (trails off)

I think it's just allergies or somethin', but I don't know what to do about the sneezin'. Can't sleep, can't eat... all because of these blasted sneezes! (sighs)"

My eyes ache, I have a dry, hacking cough, and my face and body are bloated.","""Uh, doc... breathing problems, yes... can't catch my breath no matter what I do. Even just walkin' across the room gets me winded. And these eyes... achy. Can't remember when I last got 'em checked, but it feels like they're tired all the time. Then there's this cough... dry and hacking, keeps me up at night. (pauses) Oh, speaking of nights, I had the most peculiar dream last night... about my cat, Mr. Whiskers, chasing a mouse. Anyway, back to this cough... it's been goin' on for weeks now. My face and body, they just feel... puffy. Like I'm retainin' water or somethin'. And don't even get me started on the bloating...

Now, what was it we were talkin' about again? Oh yes, breathing... (pauses) My eyes, they're killin' me, doc. Ache somethin' fierce. Like I've been stare-in' at the TV too long or somethin'. And this cough, dry as dust, like my throat's on fire. Hacking away like a old sawmill.

Bloatin' up like a balloon, that's what I am. Face, body, all of it. Can't even fit into me own clothes no more. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I had to take those weight loss pills back in '82... or was it '73? Ah, who knows? Anyway, it worked for a bit, but then I just got bored with it and stopped takin' 'em.

Now, where was I? Oh yes, breathin'. It's like my body's tryin' to drown me. (pauses) You know what's funny? I had the craziest dream last night... we were talkin' about... (trails off)

I'm having this plugged nose, you see. Can't breathe out my nose at all. And congestion, of course. Always have been a bit of a snorer, but lately it's gotten worse, if that makes sense. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I stayed with my sister in Florida? Beautiful place... anyway...

And then there's this stiffness and chest discomfort, especially at night. Not sure what that's about. Maybe it's just the weather changing or something. You know how it is when you get older... (chuckles) I was talking to my friend Edna yesterday, and she said her sister-in-law's cousin had some sort of trouble with their heart... oh dear, I'm getting sidetracked...

I mean, I'm sure I had them checked out last year at the... uh... clinic downtown? Was it downtown? *chuckles* Anyway, plugged nose and congestion, that's what they are saying these days. And stiffness in the mornings, just like my grandfather used to get. Chest discomfort at night too, a bit like... hmm, did I mention I had that chicken soup for lunch yesterday? *pauses*

Oh yes, my grandmother loved chicken soup when she was feeling under the weather. Used to make it from scratch with vegetables and noodles. Wait, what were we talking about again? Ah yes, the chest discomfort! It's like... *struggles to find words* You know how sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and your body feels all tight and stiff? Like my back is protesting something? *laughs* Oh dear, I'm getting old, aren't I?

Now, about this other thing – I think it's called... um... anosmia or something? *squints* Ah yes! Loss of smell and taste. It started a few months ago, maybe around the holidays? I remember trying to cook a big turkey for my family and thinking it smelled just fine, but nobody else seemed to like it very much... *trails off*

Oh dear, doctor, where's that cup of tea you always give me? Is it on your desk or did I leave mine in the waiting room again? *looks around* Ah yes, as I was saying – this loss of smell and taste. It's quite frustrating when you're trying to cook dinner and... uh... what was I cooking for dinner again?"

Now, where's my tea? I could've sworn I left it right here on the table... (chuckles) Anyway, like I was sayin', headaches and fever all the time. Don't know if it's related to this asthma business or not. My granddaughter said something about allergies, but I'm allergic to nothing. Unless it's dust? Or is that pollen? (shakes head)

Now let me think... what else have I been feelin'? Oh yes! Exhaustion. I mean, I'm always tired. Can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. My husband says I snore like an old chainsaw, but I don't snore that loud, do I? (laughs) Anyway... wheezing, headaches, fever, and being plumb tuckered out all the time. That's my story.

Just like that time I was helping my son move and I ended up in the hospital for a few days...","Oh boy, I'm so tired all the time... (pauses) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She always made the best apple pie... anyway... (chuckles)

This exhaustion, it's been going on for months now. Can't even get out of bed without feeling like I've run a marathon. My mouth feels funny too – there's this yucky taste that just won't go away. Like someone poured dish soap in my mouth or something. And my throat, it's always itching. Itches something fierce, if you know what I mean.

And these muscles... (rubs arm) Oh dear, they get all hot and achy at the same time. Like someone injected me with fire or ice or... uh, whatever that medicine is for pain... You know? And sometimes my whole body just locks up on me like a, well, like a metal gate in winter. (laughs) I mean, I was at my granddaughter's birthday party and suddenly I couldn't even lift my arm to give her a hug. Just crampy and sore all over.

You see, we used to have this problem with the pipes under our sink... (pauses) Oh yes! My husband was always fixing things around the house. He'd say, ""Just let it run for five minutes, dear,"" but I remember one time the whole kitchen flooded because he forgot to turn off the faucet. (chuckles)

Anyway, like I said, my muscles get all hot and achy... and then they cramp up. It's quite painful, if you know what I mean. (pauses) Did I tell you about our trip to Europe? We went on a ship and had to navigate through treacherous waters..."

(winces in pain) Ah, excuse me, doctor... what was the next appointment after this one again?","Well, doc... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm not sure if this is related, but my knees have been acting up something fierce lately. All these stairs at the house, you know?

Oh yes, food. I just can't seem to get anything down lately. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time we made those awful sugar cookies for the bake sale? Ugh, what a mess! No, no, that's not it... (clears throat)

Appetite, appetite... right. So, my taste buds just aren't working like they used to. And swallowing, dear me, it's like trying to drink from a straw with ketchup on the end. You know? Can you imagine? (laughs) 

And this nose of mine! It's been running like a faucet all day long. I swear, I went through an entire box of tissues last week. Boxes... we used to buy those big boxes of tissues at the five and dime store... what was it called again?

Now, my throat... sore, sore... (rubs throat) No, wait, that's not it either. It's like when you have a tickle in your throat from all that dust from painting the living room. Do you remember those days? (pauses)

Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up! What was the question again? Ah yes... symptoms. Well, I think it's just my age catching up with me. We used to live on a farm, you know, and we'd eat like kings. Our chickens would lay eggs like crazy, and my mother would make the most wonderful roast chicken... (trails off)"

Like, I'll be watchin' TV and suddenly I just feel... (yawns) Excuse me... sleepy. Where was I? Ah yes, fatigue. It's not just that either, it's like my whole body feels heavy. All the time.

Now, let me think... what else? Oh yes! My skin. It's all dry, you know? Like leather. (chuckles) Remember when we used to go on picnics by the lake and I'd get sunburned to a crisp? Ah, those were the days... (pauses) What was the question again?

Oh dear, where did I put that envelope with my medication list? (rummages through purse) Oh yes, here it is. Anyway, as I was sayin', my skin's been dry for ages now. And sometimes, in the mornin', I wake up and my eyes are all... (taps own eye) puffy. Ocular edema, that's what you call it, isn't it? (looks around the room) Where's my tea?

Now, what was I talkin' about again? Ah yes! The tickle in my throat. It's like a dry cough all the time. (coughs weakly) Oh dear... I hope I'm not comin' down with somethin'. I don't want to be stuck in bed like my sister Mildred was last year..."

You know, where they're trying to find a cure for something... (chuckles) Ah yes, arthritis! Anyway... I feel queasy, sick, and wobbly all the time. My throat's like a balloon, big and red, making it hard to breathe. Sometimes my chest hurts, all through the night, I think. Or was it just last night? (pauses) Oh dear, I'm getting old! And then there are these... episodes where I feel ill, but not really sure what that means. (mumbles) My granddaughter's got one of those new-fangled smartwatches... 

(clears throat) Where was I? Ah yes... the queasiness and chest pains. It's like my heart is skipping beats or something. But it goes away in the morning, thank goodness! (trails off) Now what day is today again?","(sigh) Oh dear... (pauses to collect thoughts) I don't know if you'd believe me, Doc, but I feel like I'm walkin' on eggshells nowadays...

I mean, she'd make you feel like you're right there with her, on that boat... (pauses, looks around)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, queasy. That's it. I feel all funny inside. Sick to my stomach, if you know what I mean. My throat's been actin' up somethin' fierce too. It feels like a big ol' knot in there. Makes it hard to breathe, (gulps) wheezin', that's what the nurse at the hospital called it. Wheezin'. (pauses, looks puzzled)

Chest pains at night... I know some folks get 'em from exertion, but mine just comes outta nowhere. (taps chest) Right here. Sometimes it feels like someone's squeezin' my heart in a vice... (gasps slightly) Oh dear... that sounds silly now, but trust me, it's quite real. And then there are these other times when I just feel... well, not right. Ill, I suppose. Can't exactly put my finger on it. Feels like my body's just all out of whack.

Now, have you got a minute to tell me about your garden? My sister says her roses are bloomin' beautifully this year..."

I occasionally get headaches and watery eyes from the puffing.,"You know, doc... my skin's been acting up somethin' fierce. It's swollen and itchy, and sometimes those flakes come out like dandruff on my clothes, I swear.

My cheeks and lips get all puffy and hurt somethin' awful. And them headaches! Lord have mercy, they come outta nowhere like a storm cloud. And then the eyes get all watery too... (pauses) Now, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's just like when I got that rash from eating too much beans and cabbage at one time... what year was that again? (laughs) Time sure flies, don't it?

Oh dear, sorry 'bout this. Anyway, the itching gets so bad sometimes I have to scratch through the night like a dog with fleas! (giggles) And in the mornin', my skin feels like sandpaper... what's that stuff they give me for... you know, skin issues?","I don't know if I'm doin' this right, doc... *pauses* Sorry, where was I? Ah yes... my skin, it's all... swollen and itchy, ya see. It's a nuisance, really. The itch is like... have you ever had ants crawl across your back when you're tryin' to sleep? That's what this feels like. Now, sometimes these flakes appear, tiny little things, but they can be quite... troublesome.

*chuckles* Oh, and the pain! When my cheeks and lips get all puffy, it hurts somethin' fierce. Like someone took a handful of hot coals and... *trails off*

What was I sayin'? Ah yes, my skin. And then there's these headaches... now, I could swear I used to have 'em more when I lived in the city. All that smog, you know? But I'm sure it's not that anymore... *pauses again* No, no, it's this. This new thing.

And my eyes! They water like the faucet at my granddaughter's house. My grandson loves playin' with that faucet, always turnin' it on and off... *laughs softly* What was I sayin'? Ah yes, my eyes. Watering all the time. And sometimes they get a bit... puffy too.

You see, I think it's just this one thing... or maybe it's another. Wait, where did I put that list of things? *rummages through notes* Oh dear, I don't know what I was writin' down there. *sighs* Anyway, my skin, it's a mess, doc. A right ol' mess. *pauses once more*"

(pauses) Oh dear, I got the one where... you know, with the harmonies... *sigh* Anyway... My eyes, they ache somethin' fierce. Feel like I've been cryin' all day, but there ain't no tears comin' out. And my voice... it's just gettin' worse and worse. Croakin', that's what the young folks call it, right? *chuckles*... hurts me to talk sometimes...","I'm so sorry, doc... I sneeze a lot, oh dear me, like every other minute, it seems. My nose is running something fierce, always dripping, just like my sink when the faucet's loose... wait, what were we talkin' about? Oh yes, my nose. And my eyes, they ache somethin' awful. Damp, too. Always feelin' like I got a damp cloth on my peepers. And this croakin', it's gotten so bad, people are startin' to stare... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw the opera with Ethel? We had the best seats in the house! (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my throat. It's always croakin', like a bullfrog on a lily pad.

And my head... (taps forehead) it hurts all the time. Always feelin' like there's a great big weight sittin' right between my eyebrows. You know what that's like? No, you don't, but I do! It's like tryin' to remember where I put my keys... (pauses again) Now, where did I put those pesky keys? Uh... anyway... My head hurts so much, sometimes I just wanna crawl into bed and stay there till the end of time. (trails off)

You know what would be nice? A nice cup of tea... Earl Grey's my favorite, you know. Steeped to perfection...

It just starts out of nowhere...like I'll be watching TV or cooking dinner and suddenly (coughs) excuse me...I'm sneezing all over the place.

And then my skin will get all puffy around my eyes and lips...(pauses, searching for words) You know, it's like that one time I ate too much corn at a BBQ...my lips got all swollen from the hot dogs. (chuckles) Ah, yes...this is different. It happens when I'm sneezing, and once it starts...(shrugs) I just can't stop it. Like my mouth won't close or something...(trails off)","I think I got this... sore throat, that's what it is. Been having trouble swallowing, too dry... you know how it gets when you're not drinking enough water? (pauses) Now, where was I? Ah yes, my throat. And sneezing! Oh dear lord, it's like a faucet won't turn off. Every time I try to talk or eat something... (chuckles) wait, what was I saying? Oh right, the sneezing.

Now, there are times when this skin around my eyes and lips, they get all puffy. I mean, not just a little bit, but like... well, have you ever seen a raccoon? No, no, never mind. It's just that it gets red and swollen. (pauses to think) What was the word I wanted to use? Ah yes, edema. That's what my cousin's husband has with his allergies.

But anyway, when this happens... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing at Lake Michigan? Such a lovely spot... beautiful views of the water and all that. And then there was this one summer... (gets distracted)

(hesitates) ...swell up like a balloon, just like when I eat too much of that salty soup at the church potluck. And my eyes... hurt somethin' fierce.

And then there's this cough... (coughs dryly) Ugh, it's like sand in my throat. Dry and hacky, you know? Like when I was a kid and had pneumonia back in '42 or '43... or was that the flu?

My face and torso... they're just a bit puffy, you see. Not like I've been eatin' too much watermelon or nothin'. Although, I did have some last night. At the church supper. Good cookin', but maybe not the best choice... (trails off) 

And my eyes... well, it's like someone's been pokin' me with a needle. No, that's not right. It's more like when you wake up from a nap and your eyes feel all sticky? That's what it feels like. Not very pleasant.

Now, about this cough of mine... (pauses) It's dry, so I don't know if I should be drinkin' more water or somethin'. And it hacks away, like an old washing machine in the basement. You know, my sister used to have one of those? (stops abruptly)

And don't even get me started on my sleep, doc... (mumbles to himself) I swear, I used to sleep like a baby...

But anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the nose! (laughs) It's just so blocked up. I try to use this nasal spray stuff, but it only seems to help for a little while. And then there's these other things... (trails off)

Now, what were we talkin' about again? Oh right, my symptoms! So, like I said, no sense of taste and smell left me. It's just... just... (struggles to find the words) Well, it's like tryin' to describe a color that ain't there no more, if you know what I mean.

You see, I was at my grandkids' birthday party last weekend, and we had this wonderful cake... chocolate with vanilla ice cream. Just heavenly! But then I took a bite, and (shrugs) nothing! Just like tryin' to taste air or somethin'. It's just... (sighs)

And that night, I was cookin' up some chicken soup for my wife's supper, but it smelled... well, it didn't smell like nothin' at all. Like someone took the whole aroma department outta the kitchen! (chuckles nervously)"

I get these fevers and headaches too. Always feel worn out, you know? Like I've been runnin' a marathon or somethin'. Can't even walk to the mailbox without gettin' winded now.

Anyway, food gets stuck in my throat and I have to cough it up. Vomiting after every meal, it's just terrible. (muttering to self) Should've gone to see Dr. Smith instead of Dr. Johnson last time... Ah yes! The pain in my upper abdomen, it's always there, nagging me like an old friend. (trails off) Speaks to you about it when I was at the senior center... or was that just coffee and cake?""","I'm gettin' heartburn somethin' awful... can't eat nothin' without it burnin'. And then there's this indigestion... I don't know what that means, but it feels like my chest is gonna burst open. (pauses) You know, I had the best chicken pot pie at the church social last week? It was just the best... anyway... (clears throat)

Sometimes I puke up whatever I eat. Now, I don't know if this is related, but I've been feelin' really tired lately. Must be all these years of gardenin'. My back's been actin' up somethin' fierce too... (pauses) Wasn't that a nice day today? The sun was shinin', and I saw the most beautiful robins in my yard...

Food gets stuck in my throat, makin' it hard to swallow. It's like tryin' to get a big ol' chunk of meat down there... nothin' moves. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I had that nasty cold? I was so congested, couldn't breathe for days... anyway...

This naggin' pain in my upper abdomen, doc... it's like someone's stabbin' me with a little knife all day long. Makes me feel lightheaded... (pauses) Now what was the question? Oh yes, my symptoms! I'm pretty sure it's just indigestion or heartburn, but you know how it is... (laughs weakly)

Wait, did I say chicken pot pie? No, no, that wasn't it. My wife made me those nice little sandwiches for lunch... tuna salad and all... (trails off)"

And this chest pain, it's been going on for weeks now, I think? Or was it months? I always get confused about time, anyway. My wife, Edna... no, wait, is her name Edna or Mabel? Ah, never mind. So, the pain in my chest, it radiates to my neck, jaw, and arm. It's like a big weight on me, you know? Tightness and pressure, that's what I feel. And sometimes, when I eat beans, it gets worse. Like last week... or was it two weeks ago?... I had chili for lunch, and oh boy, I was belching all day long. Sorry, what were we talking about again?""","I'm so sorry to bother you with this doc... (pauses) Excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, belching and burping, it's been happening a lot lately... can't seem to stop it no matter what I eat or drink.

(pauses) You know how sometimes you get that feeling of tightness in your chest? Like someone's squeezing it? That's what it feels like... all the time.

And it radiates, you see. Down to my neck, my jaw, even my arm. (pauses again) Now, let me think... was I supposed to bring up something about my teeth? No, no, that's not right... anyway. The pain, yes, it's been going on for a while now. And the pressure... Lord have mercy, it feels like someone's sitting on my chest (laughs nervously). My wife always says I'm just worrying too much... but this is different.

I remember when I was younger, I used to get heartburn after eating certain foods... but this isn't that. This is... (pauses) What's the word I want? Ah yes, angina! That's it. No, no, not exactly...

Time just slips away from ya. It's always there, even when I haven't eaten anything too tart. You know what's tart? Lemons. My wife used to make lemonade all the time. She'd say it was good for me... Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, this sour taste. And then there are these hiccups. They come and go, like my grandkids when they're visitin'.

You know, I was talkin' to Mabel the other day, and she said her cousin had that happen to him. Something about...um...gallbladder? Or is that the stomach? Anyway, it sounded like a real nuisance. But I'm pretty sure that's not what's goin' on with me.

I get these hiccups too. All the time. My poor throat's all achy. And then there's this...this lump feelin'. In my throat, I think. Like somethin's stuck. Maybe it's just indigestion or gas or something. You'd know better than me, dear.

I was at the Early Bird Special last week and they had them little lemon wedges on the table. And I thought to myself, ""Ah ha! That's probably it."" But then I had one and...nothin'. Still feels like this. It's just so...so frustrating. Do you think it might be...your turn now? (pauses) Oh, yes!

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my symptoms. Well, like I said, the sour taste, hiccups, and that lump in my throat. Can't even swallow sometimes. (chuckles) Guess I got a little too close to the saltshaker last night... (laughs softly)"

My cousin Edna's husband had bad breath too... or was it her brother? Anyway... (clears throat)

It started a while back now, maybe a year ago. I get this... this feeling in my mouth, like it's all dry and stuffy. And then there's this sour taste. Not just after eating anything funny, either. No, it's all the time. I brush my teeth twice a day, three times if I remember... (pauses) What was I saying? Oh yes...

You know what's weird? Sometimes when I'm eating, like with soup or something soft, I get this... tingling in the back of my throat. It makes it hard to swallow. Not that I choke, no... but it's just... uncomfortable. (pauses again) My neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, she's always complaining about her gums being sore. Maybe we should talk to someone about our gums? (gets sidetracked) Did I tell you my granddaughter's birthday is coming up? We're having cake...

This bad breath and sour taste, it comes and goes, like a... a low-grade fever, maybe? But when I'm eating, the tingling gets worse. Not that I get too thirsty or anything...

I always have this... you know, this stinky breath and that sour taste in my mouth. It's been going on for ages now... (pauses) Reminds me of when I was a girl, we didn't have all these toothpastes and whatnot. We just used salt and water to brush our teeth. (chuckles) My mother, God rest her soul, she'd say 'Eleanor, don't eat that sour apple.' But I'd say... (pauses again) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my mouth... Anyway, sometimes this tingling in my throat gets worse and makes it hard to swallow meals. Especially with soups or... you know, foods that are too hot. It's like a little sparkles on the back of my tongue, if you will. I don't know what's causing it... (trails off) Did I tell you about my nephew's new cat? Such a handful... (stops abruptly)""","I... uh... I was just thinkin' about my teeth the other day, Doc... (pauses) Oh boy, they were a mess! My sister used to take me to see Dr. Smith, and he'd always give me them sugar-coated pills... (trails off) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my breath. It's just awful, all the time. Like someone poured a can of motor oil in my mouth. Foul breath, that's what it is. And this sour taste, it's like I'm eatin' lemons... or maybe it's the dentures? No, no, I don't have dentures yet... (chuckles) Lord have mercy, I hope I never need 'em!

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my throat. It gets all tingly sometimes, and then it's hard to swallow. Mealtimes are a real struggle. My wife, bless her heart, she always tries to feed me soft food... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishin' with my cousin? No, no matter... The tinglin' in my throat, like ants crawlin' on my tongue... makes me cough, and then it's hard to breathe. But it don't happen all the time... just when I'm eatin', or sometimes at night... (yawns) Excuse me...

You know what might be causin' this? Maybe I got some acid reflux or somethin'. That's what my nephew said, anyway... He's a smart one. Always readin' them books on the internet... (trails off) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now!"

Anyway, after those meals, I just feel like my chest is on fire. And then, when I lie down to rest, the discomfort gets worse, that's for sure. It's a bit of a sharp pain, but more of a squeezing feeling, if you know what I mean. My doctor told me it was acid reflux or something... hmm, can't remember his name... (pauses) Oh, yes! My son's friend, Larry, had the same thing. He took some... some pills... Tums? Is that right? And they helped him out, but I'm not sure if those would be any good for me...","I'm gettin' these... heartburns somethin' fierce, ya know?

Ah yes... indigestion. That's what the young folks call it, right? (chuckles)

Now, my chest... it gets all achy, ya see? And if I'm feelin' good, like when I'm out in the garden, it don't bother me none. But as soon as I lie down or bend over to pick up a stick, wham!

Chest discomfort, that's what it is. It's like... have you ever had one of them... (stops) No, no, let me think on this. What was the word I wanted to use? (pauses again) Oh dearie me, I'm gettin' all mixed up! Filler words, you see... when you're my age... got too many things goin' on upstairs. (laughs) Anyway, where's my wife? I think she said somethin' about a recipe... (trails off)

I'm tryin' to remember what we were talkin' about. Ah yes, the heartburn and indigestion. My doc, Dr. Smith, he's always tellin' me to take these antacids or somethin'. But I swear, sometimes they just make it worse... or is that better? (confused)"

Well, it's been a real challenge lately. You see, my granddaughter was over just yesterday and she baked those lovely sugar cookies, just like I used to make for her when she was little... (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, food. It's just that everything looks so good, but... (sighs) no matter how small the meal, it feels like my stomach's always full. That's not right, is it? Fullness, but not from eating much? Hmm...

And then there's this heartburn business. You know, I used to have it all the time with those big ol' steaks and burgers. My goodness gracious, how did we afford them back in the day? (laughs) Oh dear, where was I going with that story? Ah yes, heartburn! It's been awful lately... always burning my throat. Nausea too. Terrible nausea. Reminds me of when I had the flu way back... (pauses, looks puzzled) Which was it, '47 or '48?

Tingling in the throat, though... that's new. Or is it? Wasn't I saying something about my teeth being all funny a little while ago? (laughs) Oh dear, sorry doc. Where are we with this whole thing? Fullness, heartburn, nausea... and now tingling? How's that for a list of complaints!"

And then there's this other thing – poor breath. Not too bad when I'm eating, but after a meal... well, you can imagine. And I've noticed, lately, I burp a lot more than usual. Too much coffee, maybe? (sighs) Now, where was I? Ah yes, the throat. It's just been going on for ages, I think since last winter... or is it spring? (laughs uncertainly)

(stammers) Ah, yes, and it's all connected, isn't it? Symptoms, food, my stomach just doesn't agree with me anymore. Fullness, burning... and this tingling in my throat, it's like a little tickle that won't go away.

Anyway... what was I saying? Oh, yes! (pauses) I remember now – we were at the movies last night, watching that nice young couple on screen..."
127,gastroesophageal reflux disease,I frequently get a scratchy voice or a painful throat when I wake up. I have bad breath and a continual sore throat. I also vomit a lot.,"( pause ) Ah, doc... (clears throat) I don't know if it's just me getting older, but I swear every morning when I wake up... (pauses again) You know, my wife always says I'm a bit of an early riser... (chuckles softly) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, the scratchy voice and throat pain. It's like sandpaper, doc! Every morning without fail. And then there's the bad breath... (hesitates) I don't want to be that person... You know, my neighbor Mrs... uh... Johnson, she always says... (trails off)

Anyways, where was I? Ah yes, sore throat. It's been going on for months now, I think. Ever since... (pauses, searching for words) what was the name of that cough syrup we got from the pharmacy? Oh dear, it starts with an ""M""... No matter, anyway. I've been getting these awful bouts of vomiting too. Can't seem to keep anything down in the morning... ( looks around the room) Do you take a coffee break around here?","I'm not sure how this started but... (pauses) You know what I was just thinkin' about? My cousin Edna, she had a scratchy throat too... or was it a cough? Anyway... (clears throat)

So, my voice gets all scratchy, ya see. And sometimes it's painful when I wake up in the mornin'. Like, it's sore, ya know? Not just from singin' too much, which I don't do as much now... or ever really. (chuckles) And then there's this bad breath business... (pauses again)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The sore throat. It's always there, like a constant companion. I've been gettin' some of these throat lozenges from the pharmacy down the street... (gets sidetracked) You know that new café on Main Street? They have those wonderful apple tarts...

Oh dear, focus! So, as I was sayin', the sore throat's a real nuisance. And then there's this vomitin' business... (hesitates) Not just in the mornin', mind you. All day long it seems like. Water comes up, too. Don't know why it's doin' that now... or has it always done that? I seem to recall my grandma... no, wait, that was different... (trails off)

Anyway... the scratchy voice and sore throat and all this vomitin'... it's just been a bother, ya see. (pauses once more) Do you think it's somethin' I ate? Or maybe some allergies or somethin'?"
128,gastroesophageal reflux disease,My throat feels as though food or acid is backing up. Lying down only makes my chest pain more. I regularly have heartburn or indigestion after eating and puke up.,"Oh dear, doc... my throat, you see, feels like it's closing up somethin', like food's gettin' stuck. Can't swallow right. And when I lie down, that chest pain gets worse, ya know? I swear, I was just thinkin' about my cousin Edna the other day... anyway... heartburn, indigestion, it's always after eatin'. And sometimes, Lord have mercy, I gotta puke up afterwards. Can't even eat a big ol' plate of my wife's cookin' without feelin' like I'm gonna... uh... yeah. That's just how it is, I reckon.","I'm telling you, doc... or is it nurse? Anyway... my throat feels funny, like something's stuck. Food, acid, I don't know... sometimes it feels like it's gonna burst. And lying down, oh boy, makes the chest pain worse. Can't even sleep without wakin' up to this... (pauses)

You know what's been on my mind? The weather. We had that big storm last week, and I was sure my roof was gonna get blown off. But then I remembered we got it fixed a few years ago. Ah, yes... anyway...

Now where was I? Oh right! My throat. So, it feels like food's backing up or somethin'. Like when you're at the sink and water gets stuck in the pipes. You know what I mean? (chuckles) And this heartburn business after every meal... ugh. It's like my stomach's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I don't speak stomach.

I puked up breakfast this morning, didn't feel so good. Tasted like... well, you know how it tastes when you're feelin' sick? (laughs) Got a bit mixed up there for a sec... my wife's birthday party last week... we had that nice big cake... hmm...

And heartburn, or is it indigestion? Same thing, right? I get it after every meal. I'm tellin' ya, doc... (pauses again) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, food and acid in my throat. Don't know what's causin' it, but it's sure a nuisance. Now I got a cough from all the... ah-choo! Excuse me... (clears throat)

Anyway, like I said, chest pain when I lie down. Don't sleep too well anymore. Guess that's just part of gettin' older... (chuckles)"
129,gastroesophageal reflux disease,I often feel sick after eating and puke up the entire meal. I constantly get excruciating acid reflux and severe stomach pain.,"""Oh dear, doctor... I think it started a while back now... maybe last year? Or was it two years ago? Oh, I'm gettin' all confused... anyway, after eatin', I feel terrible. Sick to my stomach, you know? And then I puke up the whole meal. It's like, every time I eat somethin' heavy... which is most of the time, if I'm bein' honest... (chuckles) My wife says I eat too much pasta. Anyway... acid reflux, that's what my son-in-law said it was called. He's got a degree in science or somethin', so I figure he knows his stuff... anyway, this acid reflux business gives me the worst pain in my chest... and stomach... both of 'em, really... I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna burst.""","I don't know if I should be tellin' you this, but... (pauses) excuse me, where was I? Ah yes, after eatin'. You see, doc, I often get these... these attacks. You'd think it's just heartburn, but no sir, it's more than that. It's like my stomach's on fire, and the acid, oh boy, it feels like it's burnin' a hole through me. (chuckles) Reminds me of that one time I had to get my appendix out... or was it my gallbladder? Wait, no, I remember now. My sister's cousin's husband got appendicitis, and they had to operate on him.

Anyway, where was I? Oh right, after eatin'. It feels like the whole meal comes back up, every last bit of it. (pauses) You know what would be nice right about now? A cup of tea. Earl Grey, that's my favorite. (mumbles to self) Earl Grey... or is it English Breakfast? No matter.

( Returns focus) Ah yes, the stomach pain. It's like a knife stabbin' me in the side. I try to eat somethin' light, but no such luck. And then there's this... this other thing. (pauses, searching for words) You know what it is? That thing when your food just gets stuck? Yeah, that's it! It's like my stomach's sayin', ""Nope, you're not gettin' any of that food in here today."" (laughs nervously)

(Trails off) Now, I'm sure this has somethin' to do with... uh... digestion. That's what it is, right? Digestion? (looks around the room) You know, my neighbor's kid, Jimmy, he had some kind of problem with his digestive system... something about too much cheese or somethin'. But I digress..."
130,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"My throat often feels like it is burning, especially after eating. A bitter or sour aftertaste that I occasionally experience also makes me feel unwell.","Oh dear, my throat... you see, it's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Feels like it's on fire, especially after I eat. Burnin', that's the word. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there. Like a burnin' sensation in the back of my throat. Sometimes after breakfast, sometimes not at all... hmm, was it Tuesday or Wednesday? Anyway, it's like this bitter taste that lingers. Sour, I'd say. Sour and bitter. Don't know what causes it. Must be somethin', though. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the lake? Nice spot for fishin'. Ah, yes... my throat. It's just... unwell is all. Can't quite explain it, but it's there.","(Background noises of TV in the background, distant sounds of household activity) Oh dear... my throat, you see... it's been acting up something fierce lately... (pauses) Now what was I saying? Ah yes! My throat feels like it's on fire, burning sensation, especially after eating... (muttering to self) Eating too much salt, that's probably it... always a bit of acid in the coffee, never thought about that before...

(pauses, lost in thought) Tomcat, where did I put that book? Oh dear, what was I saying again? Ah yes! After eating, my throat gets all tight and achy... can't swallow nothing down without feelin' like it's crawlin' back up. And this bitter taste... ugh! (chuckles to self) Reminds me of when I used to take those nasty cough drops for the flu... no, wait, was it the pollen allergy? (laughs) Oh dear, what a mess!

(starts rambling) Now where did I put that recipe book? Made the most wonderful chicken casserole last week... now what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes! The bitter taste. Makes me feel queasy, like my stomach's all upset and won't settle down no matter what. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Sour aftertaste, that's it. Like when I eat a lemon or somethin'... (pauses, looks around the room) Now where did I put those tea bags?"
131,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"I have indigestion and heartburn. I frequently vomit everything I eat, and it is hard for me to swallow since food gets caught in my throat. My upper abdomen is in discomfort.","""Ah, doc... you know, I've been feelin' terrible lately. Indigestion and heartburn, always somethin'. And the vomit... (pauses) Oh, sorry 'bout that. Anyway, I'm gettin' sick after every meal. Can't even swallow nothin' without food gettin' stuck in my throat. It's like a big ol' knot up there. And my stomach, it's achin', feels all tight and sore. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I ate that weird-lookin' fish at the diner... didn't agree with me one bit. Now, where was I? Oh yeah, stomach problems. Been gettin' 'em for weeks now, maybe months. Can't keep track no more... you know how it is when you're my age... (laughs) Ah, shoot, what's the name of that other condition I'm thinkin' of? You know, with the stomach and the chest pain...?""","I'm gettin' these pains in my belly again, doc... (pauses) You know what I was thinkin', I had the best cornbread at the church social last week, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't like this then... (chuckles) Anyway, indigestion. Heartburn too. It's been goin' on for a while now.

And then there's the vomitin'. Oh boy, every time I eat somethin', it comes back up again. Everything. Not just what I ate, but my whole lunch or dinner, just... (shakes head) out. Like water, you know? (pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, swallowin' ain't so easy neither. Food gets stuck in me throat. Reminds me of that one time I tried to eat a big ol' sandwich and ended up with mustard all over my shirt... (laughs) Anyway.

My upper abdomen... (taps on chest) it's just achy, like someone poked me with a pin. Not too bad, but it's there. And sometimes it feels like somethin's stuck underneath me skin, but I don't know what that is. Just feels funny. Don't rightly know how to describe it.

I did have some coffee this mornin', and it usually helps with the indigestion, but not today... (pauses) Did you hear about the new park in town? My grandkids love playin' on them swings... (trails off)

Anyway, I'm gettin' these pains and the vomitin', and food stuck in me throat. That's the main thing. (fidgets in seat)"

You know, I have this... this problem with belching and burping. It's just so... frequent. Like after meals, you'd think that's normal, but no sir, not like this. It's all day long, even when I'm not eating much. And then there's the chest pain. Oh boy, it comes on like a storm cloud. Starts in my chest, spreads to my arm, jaw... the back of my neck too. Pressure and stress in my chest, that's what it feels like. Reminds me of that time I had a gallbladder issue... or was it a stomach flu? Hmm, I always get those two mixed up... Oh dear, anyway...

I swear, it's been going on for weeks now. Maybe longer. Can't keep track of time like I used to. My wife says I should go see the doctor about it, but you know how it is. Don't want to be a bother... Ah, where was I? Oh yes, the chest pain. It's a real nuisance.","I'm gettin' these... burps now and then. Oh boy, it's like my stomach's tryin' to talk or somethin'. Frequently, I'd say. Like, every other day, maybe more often than that. And chest pain, oh dearie me... (pauses) You know, I used to have a great aunt, God rest her soul, she had the most dreadful time with heart problems. Always complainin' about it, poor thing.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my chest. It's this pressure and stress... feels like someone's puttin' their hand on me, you know how that is? (chuckles) And then there's this chest pain, spreads to my arm, jaw, and the back of my neck... (hesitates) Is it Tuesday or Thursday today, I always get those days mixed up... Wait, what was the question again?

Oh yes, the pain. Like a band around me, tight as can be. And sometimes I feel this... this heaviness in my chest. I don't know if it's related to the burps and pains, but it's just there. (pauses) Did I tell you about my neighbor's cat? The one that got stuck in the tree last week? Well, anyway...

Like I was sayin', the pressure... it's hard to explain. I don't know if it's my heart or just... (sighs) You know how sometimes you feel like someone's sittin' on you, even when they ain't? That's what this feels like. Now, let me think for a minute... (pauses, lost in thought)

Like, I'll have a sandwich, and then an hour later, my tongue's all... tangy. And I thought it was just the tomatoes or somethin', but now I'm thinkin' maybe it's more than that.

Lately, I've been gettin' these lumps in my throat, you know? Like, when I swallow, it feels like there's this big ol' rock just sittin' right below my Adam's apple. And then the hiccups... (chuckles) Oh boy, they're a nuisance! I swear, I was hiccupin' as a kid, too... or was that my brother? Hmm, might've been... anyway.

Now, let me think for a sec... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, this sour taste. It's like someone's just put a big ol' lemon slice right on the back of my tongue. Can't get rid of it no matter what I do! (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I visited my cousin in Florida? He took me to this great seafood restaurant... best conch fritters I ever had! You know, your grandmother's sister was a real good cook, wasn't she?

What was I talkin' about again? Oh right, the sour taste. And them hiccups... they come outta nowhere! Sometimes I'll be watchin' TV or sippin' my tea, and suddenly I'm hiccupin' away like it's nobody's business.

Oh right. The trouble swallowing. It's been happening more often lately, I'd say since... hmm, let me think... about a month ago? Two months? Ah, who knows? Time just flies by these days!

(pauses, looks around) I think I left my glasses here somewhere... anyway... so, you know how sometimes your throat feels like it's got pins and needles? Like when you sit on a cold floor for too long? (chuckles) My wife used to make me do that all the time as a kid... said it'd help with sciatica. Uh, no, I'm getting off track.

So, yes, my throat tingling. It's like a buzzing, but not quite. Hard to describe. Then there's this dryness in the back of my mouth... feels like my tongue's too big or something. (pauses, squints) You know what it reminds me of? When I used to go fishing with my brother-in-law on Lake Erie. The water was so calm that day... we caught more fish than we knew what to do with! (laughs)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, bad taste in the mouth. It's like someone poured a bottle of vinegar down there while I'm trying to eat. Not pleasant. And swallowing's just not right either... it's like my food gets stuck or something. Especially when I try to eat... you know... those big ol' T-bone steaks that are so hard to chew. (chuckles) My wife always said, ""Just take small bites, dear.""

(Trails off) Anyway, doc... as I was saying... this happens every now and then. Maybe a few times a week? But it's getting worse lately. Or maybe I'm just more aware of it now that I'm older.

Heartburn and indigestion, yes, that's what it is. Been gettin' it for years now. Spicy food, fatty food... you name it. My stomach just can't take it no more. (pauses to think) I remember when my cousin Ed had a similar problem... (trails off) No, wait, that was his brother Bill...

Okay, so heartburn and indigestion. It's like a burnin' sensation in my chest, especially after eatin'. (hesitates) Now, let me think... what else? Ah yes! When I lean forward or lie down... it gets worse. That's when the real pain starts. Chest hurts a lot... (pauses to collect thoughts)

You know, doc, I was just at my granddaughter's house for dinner the other night... and she made this wonderful chicken parmesan. But boy, did it give me trouble! (laughs) My wife always says I should eat more fiber... but what's that got to do with anything? (chuckles)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, heartburn. It's just the worst when you're tryin' to enjoy a nice meal. (pauses again) I swear, I could've sworn I took some of them Tums for this exact thing... but did I really? (shrugs) Oh well...

Fullness? (pauses again) Lingering fullness, you said? That sounds right. Even after a little snack, just something light... not even hungry, but still feel stuffed up.

I mean, my throat's always irritated, and my breath's not too great either. People start backing away from me at church.

What was that thing they said about vocal cord problems?... something with 'inflammation'... uh...

And then there's this vomiting business. (hesitates) It started a few months ago. Now, I'm not one to complain, but it's getting in the way of my morning coffee routine. Can't even enjoy my cereal without feeling queasy. Oh dear, speaking of cereals... have you tried that new oatmeal with honey? Just like when I was a kid...

Chest discomfort, you see, gets worse when I lie down. Don't know why, it just does. (mumbles to self) Should've taken those vitamins like the doctor said... oh right! Now where was I? Ah yes, the lying down part. So, it feels tight, like someone's got their hands around my chest.

After eatin', which is often, I get this... heartburn, indigestion, they call it. (pauses, looks confused) Did I take that pill for gas? No, no, that was last week... I think. Anyway, after eatin', it starts. And then the vomiting. Yes, that's what it is. Vomiting. Like when I had the flu back in '52. Oh boy, those were some bad days.

(chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I'm getting old, can't keep track of time anymore. As I was saying, after eating, I get this feeling like someone's squeezing my stomach with a vise grip... excruciating discomfort, that's what the doctor said, I think.

And then there's this acid reflux business... (pauses to collect thoughts) You know, my sister-in-law had something similar. She was on some meds for it... Omeprazole, or was it Ranitidine? (trails off) Oh dear, that reminds me! I need to call the grandkids and tell them to pick up their coats from the dry cleaner...

Now, where were we again? Ah yes, my symptoms! So, after eating, I throw up the whole meal... every single time. It's not just food, though; it's this bitter taste in the back of my throat, like someone poured acid down there. (coughs) Excuse me... Oh dear, I think I left the stove on at home...

Painful? You want to know if it hurts? (pauses for a moment) Let's just say I've been taking Maalox by the bucketload, and even that doesn't seem to do much good. Now, where did I put my keys..."

I occasionally get a bitter or sour aftertaste that makes me feel sick.","""Ah, yes... my throat, you see... gets all scorching-like after I eat, especially... (pauses) Reminds me of that time I had them chili dogs at the county fair... my stomach was aching for days! (chuckles) Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the scorching. It's like someone poured hot sauce right down my gullet. And then, sometimes after eating... (pauses again) I think it was Tuesday, but maybe not... anyway, after lunch, I get this bitter or sour taste in my mouth. Makes me feel queasy, you know? Like something's stuck in my throat and won't come out. Ugh! Like when Edna had that stomach bug last year... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I saying?""","Doc... (pauses) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my throat. It's like a wildfire in there after eatin'. You know, I went to church last Sunday and the pastor talked about... uh... spiritual fires? No, no, that's not it. Anyway, after dinner, especially when I have a big meal, my throat feels scorching hot. Like someone poured gasoline on it. (chuckles) Oh dear, my wife always says I'm dramatic.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It's like a burning sensation that never goes away. Sometimes, if I eat too quickly, or maybe it's because of the food itself... (pauses, looks around the room) You know, I had a nice piece of chicken last night, but my wife said it was cooked a bit too long. Maybe that's it. Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now.

Oh yes, the taste. Occasionally, after eating, I get this bitter or sour aftertaste in my mouth. (pauses) You know what would be nice right now? A glass of lemonade. My grandmother used to make the best lemonade... (trails off)

Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes! The taste. It's like someone put a sour pickle in my mouth. (laughs) And then I feel queasy for a bit. Like I'm gonna get sick or something. My stomach does flips and flops. No, no, that's not right... my heart beats fast. That's what happens when you eat too much spicy food. Or is it? Ah dear, I always mix those two up.

Anyway, (clears throat) I hope this makes sense to you, doc..."
141,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"I have heartburn and indigestion. I regularly throw up everything I eat, and swallowing is difficult for me since food gets stuck in my throat. I'm experiencing pain in my upper abdomen.","I've been havin' some trouble with heartburn and indigestion... (pauses) You know, I had the most peculiar thing happen yesterday. I was eatin' my cereal, and my grandson came in, startin' to tell me about this newfangled gadget his wife got him for his birthday... anyway...(chuckles)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, heartburn. So, it's been goin' on for a while now. Food just keeps gettin' stuck in my throat, makin' it hard to swallow. And when I do try to eat somethin', it comes right back up again... (pauses, looks around the room) Did I tell you about the time I was at the farmer's market last week? Got a lovely bunch of fresh herbs for my soup... (trails off)

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Pain in my upper abdomen. It's been botherin' me somethin' fierce lately. Hard to explain, but it's like a burnin' sensation, ya know?","I don't know if I should be seeing you today, but I guess it couldn't hurt, could it? Anyway... (pauses) heartburn and indigestion, yes, that's what it is. Always feel like this acid thingy's burning my insides. And then the vomiting, oh boy... everything comes back up. Just can't keep nothing down no more. It's been weeks now, months even... I think? (chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gone again...

Food gets stuck in my throat, that's the worst part. Swallowing's become a chore. Makes me feel like I'm choking all the time. I try to take small bites, but it doesn't help. Just feels like something's lodged there. Like a... a cork, yes, that's it! A cork stuck in my throat.

(Trails off) You know, I had a cousin who had this problem once... or was it my aunt? Ah, they said it was a hiatal hernia, but I never did get the details... (sighs) Anyway...

Pain in my upper abdomen. Yes, that's where it hurts. Always a dull ache, like someone's pressing on me from the inside out. And this burning, it doesn't go away. Not even with antacids or that Tums stuff... (pauses again) What was I saying? Oh right! The heartburn and indigestion... just seems to get worse as time passes..."

Stresses me out somethin' fierce. And then it radiates to my arm and jaw and neck too. My arm gets all tingly and whatnot. (pauses) I remember when I was your age, my friend Ed... or was it Bob? Anyway, we went fishin', and I had the most wonderful fish fry afterwards. (chuckles) Ah yes! The belching. Yeah, that's a problem too. I burp and belch like crazy.

I've been gettin' these, uh, noises in my stomach, ya know? *pauses* Burps and belches, just outta nowhere! Can't seem to help it. My doc from down the street said maybe I should lay off the beans, but, you see... I like a good bean supper every now and then. My wife used to make 'em for me when we were first married... *chuckles* Oh boy...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the burps. So, after that comes this chest discomfort. It's hard to describe, but it's like someone's put a knot in there. And then, you know how sometimes you get these pains in your arm and jaw when you're havin' a heart attack? *hesitates* Not sayin' I'm havin' one, mind you... But this is kinda like that. It radiates down to my neck, too. Tight, stressed... That's the word! Stressed. Like someone's put their foot on my chest and won't let up.

Now, what was it I came here for again? Oh right! My back's been actin' up somethin' fierce, too. Might be that new mattress we got... *trails off* We used to have a wonderful king-sized bed, with the adjustable headboard... You know, one of them fancy-schmancy ones? I swear, my wife would... uh... *clears throat* Sorry about this, doc. As I was sayin', the chest thing's been goin' on for weeks now. I'm not sure if it's related to the burps or what, but..."
143,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"I always get a sour taste in my mouth, even when I don't have anything acidic in my stomach. I regularly have the hiccups and a knot in my throat.","You know, doc... I been gettin' this sour taste in my mouth, even when I'm eatin' nothin' that'd give me heartburn or none of them other acidic things. It comes outta nowhere, like a storm cloud on a sunny day. Speakin' of which, I was at the park last week, and I saw that new young fella playin' fetch with his dog... nice kid. Anyway, back to my mouth. It's like someone poured vinegar right down there. And then there's these hiccups, doc... they come on so sudden, it's like somethin' inside me just... hic! Ah, pardon me. Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Yes, the hiccups and this knot in my throat... it's like a fishbone stuck there or somethin'.","I don't know if I told you already, doctor... but anyway... my mouth always feels sour, even when I eat nothing but plain toast for breakfast... and that's what I did this morning, by the way, had some tea with it... Ah, yes... so, like I was saying, my mouth is all sour all the time. It's not just when I eat something acidic or anything... no, no... it's like it's always like that... unless... unless I drink some milk, and then it goes away for a bit... Hmm...

And you know what else? I've been getting these hiccups... a lot lately... I mean, I don't know if they're related to the sour taste or not... But anyway... they come and go. One day they're all gone, and the next, oh boy... I'm hiccuping like crazy. And then there's this knot in my throat... it feels like a little ball just stuck in there... I don't know how else to describe it... Sometimes it hurts when I swallow, but other times... it's just there.

Now, let me think for a second... (pauses) I had this cousin, God rest his soul... his name was Eddie... and he always got these hiccups too. Yeah, that's right! He'd hiccup so bad sometimes we'd have to take him outside to calm down... (chuckles) Good times...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the knot in my throat... it comes and goes like the hiccups. Sometimes I think it's going away, but then it just pops right back up again... Like a little surprise party for my esophagus or something..."

Like little needles pokin' at me. And then there's this... this smell. (shudders) Terrible breath, I'm afraid. My husband always says I need to floss more often... (chuckles)

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the taste in my mouth. It's just awful. Like someone poured sulfuric acid on my tongue. (pauses, lost in thought) You know, I had a cousin who used to suffer from that same problem. Her name was Edna... no, wait, it was Emily... or was it Margaret? (laughs) Oh dear, I always get those names mixed up.

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the symptoms. Well, like I said, my throat tingles and I've got this nasty taste in my mouth. And sometimes, after dinner, I'll feel this... this lump. Like a golf ball's stuck in there. (gestures to throat) It's quite unpleasant, let me tell you.

My son-in-law says it's because I'm eating too much cheese, but I say... (pauses) what was I saying? Ah yes, the pain in my chest. It really hurts when I lean forward, like yesterday at church, I had to get up and leave during the sermon 'cause it felt like someone was squeezing me.

And lying down doesn't help either, Doc. It's like a weight on my chest... (hesitates) now what was that other thing I wanted to tell you? Oh yes! My heartburn is awful too.

Anyway, so the indigestion's been actin' up. And then there's this chest pain... hurts somethin' fierce when I lean forward or... (hesitates) What was it again? Oh yeah, when I'm layin' down too. My grandma used to say that was a sign of high blood pressure or somethin'. I don't know...

And it hurts a lot! (pauses) You know what's funny? I was thinkin' about my old neighbor, Mr. Jenkins... he had the most wonderful garden in the world. Always growin' these giant tomatoes and... (trails off) Oh dear me!

Where was I? Ah yes, this chest pain. It feels like it's all the time now. Especially after eatin', like I said. But sometimes it's not just that. Sometimes it comes on without warnin'. Like last week when I was out with my book club... we were talkin' about our grandkids and (pauses) Hmm, what were we talkin' about again? Oh yes, the grandkids! That's right.

Now, let me think for a minute... (pauses to collect thoughts) What was I eatin' yesterday? Ah yes, chili! Had that chili for dinner and... (chuckles) Oh dear, I remember now! My wife's sister, she had the same problem when we were at her house last week. Just... just can't eat nothin', I tell ya.

Stomach discomfort... that's what my grandson says it is. He's a smart one, always readin' them health books and... (excitedly) Oh boy! Did I ever tell you about the time I went fishin' with him last summer? Caught us two big ol' basses! (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, stomach discomfort. It's like... it's just a crampy feelin', doc. Like my belly's all knotted up and... (pauses again) You know what I mean. And then the pukin', like I said. Just can't eat nothin' without makin' myself sick. Sorry to be so much trouble, doc..."

My throat, yes. It's like someone poured gasoline down there. No, no, not gasoline. That would be bad. Fireworks, maybe. (laughs) I remember when... oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my throat. So, it feels all hot and achy. Like a burn, but it's not from the stove or anything. Although, I did burn myself on the stove last week... (trails off)

Now, about this aftertaste business... (pauses) It's sour, bitter. Reminds me of those lemon drops my mother used to give me when I was a child. You know, those yellow ones? Not too sweet, just right for a grown-up like me. (laughs nervously) 

Oh dear, what's the point of all this? Nauseous, you said? That's it! When I get that sour taste in my mouth, I do feel... queasy. Like I need to sit down or something. But I'm not sure why. Maybe I just ate too much chili for lunch. (pauses again) You know what they say about chili: it'll clear out your sinuses, but maybe that's not what you meant, doctor... (trails off)

Oh, yes! The hiccups. I get 'em so often now, it's like my body's just given up on me altogether. (laughs) My friend Edna told me to try drinkin' water upside down... (pauses once more) Wait, was that a remedy for something else? Uh, anyway...

Fever's got me all... foggy. Don't know if it's the house or just my mind playin' tricks on me. Always gettin' mixed up between my late husband's birthday and my own. Same thing happened last week with grandma's recipe for chicken soup, thought I was makin' it for Thanksgiving dinner. (laughs)

Now where was I? Ah yes! Heart's racin', feels like a jackrabbit in my chest. Can't concentrate on nothin'. My mind's all... all fuzzy. Got some pills at home that might help with the fever, but what's their name again? The ones with... (pauses) Oh dear me, I just remembered I have to water the plants today! That reminds me of when we used to go fishin' on Wednesdays after school...

What was it I was tellin' you about? Ah yes! Confused and feelin' all wobbly. Can't think straight no more. (gulps) Don't know what's wrong with me, but I do know I need... some of those tea bags for my throat. Now where did I put 'em?"
153,drug reaction,I have rashes on my skin and these flake off from time to time. This leaves me prone to infection. My fingers start twitching and sometimes I experience tremors.,"You know, I've had these rashes on my skin for... um, well, let me think... could have been a few weeks now? I don't rightly recall. They come and go, but when they're here, oh dearie me, it's like... (chuckles) reminds me of that one time at the lake house, we had a big ol' picnic and I got some sorta rash from a bug bite. Anyway...

Oh yes, these rashes! So, they flake off sometimes, and then my skin gets all red and sensitive. I'm afraid it leaves me more prone to infection... you know, like that cold I had last winter? (pauses) What was the name of the doctor who gave me those pills for it? Ah, doesn't matter now... anyway...

My fingers start twitchin', too. It's a bit embarrassing, but sometimes they just... (twitches finger involuntarily) Oh, pardon me! As I was sayin', my fingers and hands, sometimes they get these... tremors, is that the word? Yes, tremors. It's quite unsettling, if you ask me.","I don't know if I should be tellin' you this, but... (pauses) My skin, well... it's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Got these rashes on my arms and legs, and they just flake off, like dust, ya know? Leaves me feelin' all scratchy and whatnot. And don't even get me started on the infection part – (trails off) Wait, was I supposed to pick up some more... (pauses again) Oh yes, them infections! They're a real problem for me now.

(muttering to herself) I remember when my grandmother used to make those little bread rolls... you know, with the sesame seeds on top? Good Lord, she could bake like nobody's business... (snaps back to attention) Ah, right! My symptoms. So, these rashes, they're not just a nuisance – they hurt, too. And sometimes my fingers start twitchin' all on their own. Like this (twitches finger). It's quite the sight, I assure you.

(rambles on) Now, where did I put that book? The one with the pictures of... (pauses, looking around the room) Oh dear, what was it called again? (chuckles nervously) Ah, yes! My tremors! That's what I meant to say. These... these tremors... (stammers, struggling to continue) Oh, for Pete's sake! They come outta nowhere – I'll be sippin' my tea, and suddenly my hands are shakin' like a leaf.

(sighs) Sorry about all this, Doc... or whoever you are. (chuckles weakly) I just get so mixed up sometimes."
154,drug reaction,I feel very nauseous and have chest pain. Recently I have been experiencing chest pain. I feel very uneasy and often sweat profusely,"Doc... (pauses) I'm feelin' real poorly. This nausea business, it just hit me outta nowhere. Can't eat nothin', can't even keep water down. Chest pain, that's been goin' on for a while now. Must be weeks? Months? (chuckles) Shoot, my mind ain't as sharp as it used to be... anyway. Chest pain, yeah. And I'm sweatin' like a pig all the time. Just walkin' down the street, sweat drippin' off me like I just stepped outta the shower. Don't know what's causin' it, maybe that new medication I started takin'? (pauses) You know, I saw my friend Edna last week... or was it the week before? She said she made some mighty fine chicken soup... (trails off) Oh, and this nausea, it's gettin' worse. Real bad. Like I'm gonna be sick at any minute.","I don't know if I should be talkin' about this now... (pauses) Oh boy, my stomach's been churnin' like a washing machine all day. Nauseous? Is that what they call it? I feel very... uh... queasy. Can't keep nothin' down. And then there's this chest pain business. Been goin' on for weeks now. (pauses) Weeks, that's right! My wife's birthday was last week, and we had a nice dinner at the diner downtown. Best roast beef I ever had... (trails off)

Anyway, this chest pain... it comes and goes. Mostly when I'm eatin', but sometimes just sittin' still too. Like my heart's gonna give out or somethin'. Unsettlin', I tell ya. (chuckles) Then there's the sweatin'! Lord have mercy, I must've lost five pounds in sweat alone this summer. Always drippin' like a faucet. Can't even walk down to the mailbox without breakin' a sweat... (pauses) Oh boy, and my knees. My knees are actin' up something awful.

Now, let me think on this... (pauses again) What was I sayin'? Ah yes! Nausea and chest pain! And them nightmares I've been havin' too. Wake me right up in the middle of the night with a start. Like someone's tap-tap-tappin' on my window, tryin' to get my attention... (pauses once more) Now where's my coffee?"
155,drug reaction,"I have itching all over my body, and rashes in my chest and back. I get flaky skin from time to time and often this leaves marks on my body.","""I've been gettin' these... itchies everywhere. My whole body's just scratchin', you know? And then I saw this one spot on my chest, it was all red and bumpy like a rash. And now I got 'em on my back too. Flaky skin comes and goes, but when it does, oh boy... it leaves these marks. I think it was last week, or was it two weeks ago? Anyway, I remember I saw the doc about that one spot near my shoulder, what's his name... you know, Dr. Johnson? No, no, that's not right... anyway, I've been takin' them creams and ointments, but this just keeps on goin'. Now my granddaughter, bless her heart, she loves bakin', reminds me of my sister Edna, God rest her soul...""","Oh dear... I think it's these new laundry detergent things... always seems to give me trouble... itching all over my body, you know? Can't even sit still sometimes... (chuckles) My knees, they creak like an old door... just like my grandmother's porch in West Virginia. Anyway...

Rashes on my chest and back, that's the worst part. Makes me feel so scratchy... I mean, what was I saying? Ah yes, rashes. It's not too big of a deal, but it's... (pauses) Did we go to the beach last summer? No, no, we stayed in. My wife said something about a skin condition... eczema, that's it! Eczema, or is it atopic dermatitis? (laughs nervously)

I get flaky skin, oh boy... those flakes just fall off like snowflakes on the roof. Leave marks everywhere... ( mutters to self) why do I always forget where I put my reading glasses?... oh yes, skin. My granddaughter's got eczema too, poor thing... Anyway...

Now, what was it that doctor said about dry skin? Oh yes, moisturize, moisturize! I get on the moisturizer like there's no tomorrow... but sometimes these flakes just won't go away... leave those pesky marks behind. (chuckles to self) What a life, huh?

Oh dear, now where did I put that bottle of cream my wife got me? (pauses, looks around) You know what they say: ""If you can't remember your age, don't worry about it.""... (laughs) Now I'm worried!"
156,drug reaction,I have hair loss and there is a significant change in the texture of my hair. I have  dry and itchy sclap and increased dandruff. My skin is also getting very dry,"I'm gettin' bald, you know? My hair's fallin' out somethin' fierce. And the texture, dearie me... it's like straw. Yeah, that's what it is. I was just talkin' to my cousin Edna about this, but I think she said it was just a phase. You know, one of them phases? Anyway, my scalp, it's so dry and itchy. Can't even scratch it without wincin'. And dandruff, oh boy... it's like snowflakes on my shoulders. Just the other day, I saw this fella in the park with a full head of hair, and I thought to myself, ""What's his secret?"" But, uh, no, not me. My skin, too... it's so dry, even after showerin'. Do you think that's related?","I don't know if I've been tellin' you this before, but... my hair's just fallin' out in clumps, dearie me. It's like snowflakes on a cold winter day. And the texture, well... it's all thin and brittle now. Not like when I was young, of course. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I won that prize for growin' my hair longest at the county fair? (chuckles) Ah, never mind.

Anyway, as I was sayin', my scalp... (hesitates) Oh dear, it's all dry and itchy now. Like when I used to help with the gardenin' and get those sap stains on my hands. And the dandruff! Goodness gracious, it's like a whole other person lives in there, flakin' away like crazy. You'd think I was allergic to... (pauses) Is that what they call it? An allergy?

Now, my skin... (hesitates again) It's just so... parched. Like when I forgot to water the plants last summer and they all shriveled up. And have you seen the price of moisturizer these days? Steep, if you ask me. (mutters to self) Too much money...

(Regains focus) Oh, right! My skin. So dry it's like... (pauses once more) How do I put this? Like when I used to go fishin' and get those saltwater burns on my hands? Ah, yes! And now they say I'm supposed to be careful with the sun too. (looks around the room) Do you have some of that nice lemon-flavored ice tea here somewhere?"
157,drug reaction,I am experiencing a decrease in my sex drive and difficulty to fucntion sexually. I feel very light headed and confused and often experince brain fog,"I'm havin' some trouble with... you know, down there. My sex drive's just not what it used to be, doc. (pauses) I remember when my husband and I first got married, we'd... (chuckles) Oh boy, I'm gettin' old. Sorry 'bout this. Where was I? Ah yes, sex. It's just hard for me now. Fuhgeddaboutit. (laughs softly)

I feel like a feather in the wind, doc. Light-headed all the time. Can't concentrate no more. My brain's foggy as a... well, you know what I mean. Brain fog, that's it! (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, let me think when was this startin'? Was it last year? Or was it the year before? Oh dear, my memory's not what it used to be neither...","I don't know if I can... ah, you see what I mean? My mind gets all... foggy. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishing with Joe? No, wait, that was last week. (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway...

As I was saying, my... uh, drive. You know what I'm talking about. It's just not there anymore. (sighs) Doctor said it's normal for people our age, but I don't feel normal. (trails off)

I get these feelings of... lightheadedness. Like I might fall over if I stand up too quick. My wife says I'm always holding onto the furniture for support. (laughs nervously) And my brain! It's like trying to remember where I put my keys, but they're right there in front of me.

I had a bit of a scare last week. Thought I was at the store, but it turned out to be... uh, what was it? Ah yes, my garden shed. (chuckles) Oh dear...

Sexually, well... it's just not working like it used to. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I mention I saw a nice bird outside my window this morning? Lovely blue jay... anyway.

I don't know if these things are connected, but... (hesitates) what was the question again? Oh yes, my symptoms. Well, I do get a bit... tired easily now. And sometimes I have to think really hard about what day it is. Or even what month! (laughs nervously)

Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up. (pauses, takes deep breath) Sorry, doctor. Where was I? Ah yes... my symptoms. Well, I hope you can help me figure this out."
158,drug reaction,I am experiencing changes in my menstrual cycle and unexpected vaginal discharge. I often get mood swings and feel agitated from time to time,"I'm gettin' these... changes in my cycle again. You know, like I was just talkin' to Helen from down the street about it the other day? Anyway... (pauses) Oh dear me, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! My period's been irregular for weeks now. Sometimes it's heavy, sometimes it's light. And don't even get me started on the discharge. It's like... (hesitates) well, I'm not sure how to explain it, but it's just... (pauses again) Oh, I remember when my mother used to get these same problems! She'd say it was the change of life and all that jazz.

Now, let me see if I can recall when this started. Was it last month? Or is it this month? Ugh, time sure gets away from you! Anyway... (clears throat) The mood swings, well, they're just awful. One minute I'm fine, the next I'm wantin' to yell at... (pauses once more) Oh dear Lord, what's that thing on TV again? You know, with all those young folks runnin' around? (chuckles) Ah yes! My nerves are shot, if you ask me. These agitations, they just come out of nowhere and won't quit.","I'm not sure if I should be talkin' about this... but my periods, they're gettin' all wonky now. I mean, I don't know what's goin' on. One day it's like clockwork, and the next... well, I'm not even sure when I last got mine, to be honest. (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, that sounds silly, doesn't it? 

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my periods! Like I said, they're all over the place now. And then there's this discharge... well, it's not always there, but when it is, it's like a bit of a mess, if you know what I mean. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Oh, wait, did I tell you about my niece? She just had twins! Such precious little things... (gets sidetracked)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the discharge. It's like... have you ever seen it, doctor? No, no, of course not. You wouldn't know what to look for, would you? (giggles) Oh dear me...

And mood swings! Good grief, I get so irritable sometimes. Like yesterday, I was cookin' dinner and suddenly just... (makes a hissing sound) Well, it's like the world just lost all reason. Now, don't you worry about me, dear... I know I'm not exactly the most rational person these days... (smiles weakly)

Wait, what else? Ah yes! Sometimes I get this feeling... of being watched, or somethin'. (leans in close) Do you think it's possible to have a tumor or somethin' that makes me feel like I'm goin' crazy?"
159,drug reaction,I have experinenced significant weight gain and become very obese. I have changes in my appetite and cravings for different foods,"Doc... I'm tellin' ya, I've gained so much weight, it's just not right. I mean, I was always a bit on the heavier side, but this is somethin' else. My stomach's been actin' up, too - I get these awful hunger pangs, and then suddenly I don't want to eat nothin'. Yesterday, I think it was... or was it the day before? Anyway, I had the craziest craving for pizza. Now, I love a good slice as much as the next person, but this was different. It was like my brain was tellin' me, ""Eat all the cheese!"" And don't even get me started on sugar - I've been puttin' it in my coffee like there's no tomorrow...","I'm gettin' a bit... (pauses) Excuse me, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! Weight gain. Been happenin' for... um... how long now? Let's see... my sister's birthday party last year... I had that big plate of fried chicken and mac 'n cheese... Mmm, just thinkin' about it makes me hungry! (chuckles) Anyway...

Where was I? Ah yes! Weight gain. I've gained so much weight, doc... (pauses to think) Must be 20 pounds at least. Maybe more. You know how it is when you're gettin' older, and your metabolism slows down like my neighbor's lawn mower? (laughs) Oh dear!

Food cravings, that's the other thing. I wake up in the middle of the night cravin' ice cream. Not just any ice cream, mind you! My wife says it's because I ate too much salt at dinner, but I know what I'm talkin' about! Sometimes it's pizza, sometimes it's... (trails off) You know that nice little café downtown? We went there for breakfast last week... Best pancakes in town...

Changes in appetite, you say? Well, I'll tell ya, doc. Some days I can eat a whole chicken by myself, and the next day, I don't want nothin' but toast and tea! (chuckles) My wife says I'm gettin' old-fashioned, just like my grandfather's recipes... (gets sidetracked) Did you know we used to make our own bread from scratch? Ah!

That's about it for now. Weight gain and strange food cravings. And maybe... just maybe... a touch of forgetfulness. (laughs nervously) What was I sayin'?"
160,drug reaction,I have difficulty in maintianing concentration and very low mental clarity. I often forget things and in general have difficulty remembering things,"""Ah, ya know, doc... I've been havin' trouble focusin', you see. Can't sit still for too long without gettin' all fuzzy-headed. It's like my brain's a, uh, a TV that ain't tunin' in right. (pauses) I remember when I was on the farm, I had to fix this old tractor, and... oh boy, it was a mess! (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, my mind's goin'. It's like I'm tryin' to recall somethin', but it's just... gone. Like that time at the church social, we were talkin' about our grandkids... I think it was your time, doc? (laughs) Ah dear, what's the name of that medication you gave me last week? Oh, never mind! (clears throat) So, like I said, I get these... uh, gaps in my memory. Can't remember things from one minute to the next. It's quite frustrating, if you know what I mean.""","I don't know if I'm making any sense... (pauses) You know what? My sister used to say I was like a chicken in the yard, pecking around for food. That's not it exactly... (chuckles) What was I saying?

Oh yes! Concentration. It's like trying to hold water in my hand. It just slips right through. And that low mental clarity? Lord have mercy, it's like fog rolling in off the lake. Can't think straight no more.

You know what's funny? I was talking to my neighbor Edith yesterday and she told me her cousin's son-in-law used to be a professor at the university... (pauses) Wait a minute! What were we discussing again?

Oh right, concentration. And memory. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, but the haystack is on fire! (laughs) I swear, I was just making myself a sandwich and then suddenly I couldn't remember where I put the bread... or the bread box...

Now what was that other thing? Ah yes! Forgetting things. Just like my aunt Mildred used to say: ""You can't have a memory without having forgotten something first."" (nods) Makes sense, doesn't it?

What's that noise in here? Is that the air conditioning? Always sounds like someone's trying to knock on the door..."
161,drug reaction,"In addition to experiencing a change in taste and fragrance, I also have a metallic aftertaste in my tongue. occasionally get excruciating joint and muscular pain","""Ah, you see... doctor... I've been having these troubles for... well, let me think on it... my granddaughter's birthday party was last weekend, but I'm not sure if it started then or before. Anyway... (pauses) Oh, my taste buds, dear Lord! One day they said tomatoes were sweet, the next they're bitter! And them smells? Forget about it! My wife's perfume one day, a nice lavender, and the next... (chuckles) I don't even know what that is. And my tongue, oh boy! Metallic aftertaste, like I've been sucking on a penny all day... or was it copperhead pennies? Never mind... joint pain too, you see... my knees ache something fierce... and my back, like someone's poking me with a sharp stick.""","Mmm... doctor, you know what I've been having trouble with? Oh dear, my tongue, it's like... it's all metallic, you see. Taste and smell, they're just not right anymore. My grandkids would say, ""Grandma, why are you sniffing the air?"" And I'd say, ""I'm smelling the cake, dear!"" But no, it's not the cake, is it? *pauses*

Metallic taste, yes... that's what it feels like. Sometimes my joints ache so much... (sigh) You know, I used to be able to dig in my garden for hours without a problem. Now, just thinking about getting up from this chair gives me pain. My back, my knees... *hesitates* Where was I? Ah yes...

And the smell, it's all wrong too. Like someone put perfume on my furniture or something. (laughs) Oh dear, I wish they would! I love a good scent in the house. But no, this is different. It's like... have you ever noticed how some foods just don't taste right? *gets distracted* You know, I had the most wonderful beef stew at my sister-in-law's house last week...

Beef stew... mmm... anyway, as I was saying, it's like there's something stuck in my tongue. And sometimes I get these twinges in my hands and feet... (pauses) Now where did I put that recipe for chicken pot pie? *chuckles* Oh dear, I think I left it on the kitchen counter...

Excuse me, doctor, I'm getting a bit off track, aren't I? *looks around the room* Oh yes, my symptoms. Joint and muscle pain... (hesitates) Now what was that thing I came here to tell you about again?"
162,drug reaction,"I suffer migraines and headaches, and I've been having trouble falling asleep. My muscles have been trembling and twitching. I sometimes feel dizzy.","You know, doc... (pauses) Migraines and headaches, they come and go, but lately... (hesitates) I don't know if it's the weather or what, but my head's been achin' somethin' fierce. And sleep? Forget about it! Can't catch a wink to save my life. My muscles, well... (taps foot) they've been shakin' and twitchin', like a leaf in a storm. Dizzy spells too, I'm afraid. Now, let me think... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the headaches. They're on both sides, but one side's worse than the other... or is it? (chuckles) Sorry, doc, gettin' old's got its perks, but... (trails off)

(Background noise: muffled sounds of a TV in the background, occasional murmurs of another person in the room)

Oh, and I just remembered! My sister-in-law, Edna... no, that's not right, her name's Ethel... anyway, she had migraines too. She'd say, ""Just take some aspirin"" and... (pauses) oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the tremors! They started a few weeks ago, after I saw the new doctor at the clinic. Or was it last week? Hmm...","I'm gettin' these headaches again, you know? Been havin' 'em for weeks now. And the migraines, Lord have mercy... I had one last week that lasted three days straight. I was stuck in bed with a cold compress on my forehead and a glass of water beside me... (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?

Oh, right. Headaches. And sleep, I haven't been able to fall asleep at all! Can't even get comfortable. My mind's racin', goin' a million miles an hour. Like when I was a young'un and I'd work at the factory all day... (chuckles) Oh boy, them were some long days...

Now where was I? Ah yes, sleep troubles. And my muscles, they're just jumpin' all over the place! Trembling and twitchin', it's like my body's got a mind of its own. (pauses to collect thoughts) You know what it reminds me of? When I used to get these awful cramps in my legs... no, wait, that was my sister Margaret. She'd get those awful leg cramps.

Oh dear, focus! Right. The dizziness. That's been happenin' too. Like when I'm walkin' down the street and suddenly everything goes all swirly. (laughs nervously) Course it doesn't help bein' on these meds... (trails off)

Now what was it you wanted to know again, doc?"
163,drug reaction,"I'm feeling really lightheaded and dizzy when I have a temperature. My mind is completely muddled, and my heart is racing. I find it difficult to think clearly, and everything seems quite hazy.","""Oh dear, I'm feeling really... lightheaded. You know, like when I was at my sister's house last week and we had that big ol' family dinner? (pauses) Anyway... anyway, it happens whenever I have a temperature. My mind is completely... (hesitates) muddled. That's the right word, isn't it? Muddled? Yeah, I'm sure of it. And my heart, dear me... it's racing like a rabbit. (chuckles) Just like that little bunny we used to watch on TV when I was a girl. Um, what was its name again? Oh well, doesn't matter. The point is, everything seems quite hazy and... and difficult to think about. You know how it is when your mind's all foggy?""","You know, I'm feeling... (pauses) lightheaded, that's what it is. Dizzy-like. Temperature, you see, and then...(pauses again) my mind gets all foggy. Completely muddled. Can't think straight no more. Like trying to recall a recipe... or was it a story? Anyway...(chuckles)

My heart's racin' like a rabbit in a sack! (giggles) I swear, I used to have a rabbit named Benny when I was a girl... good Lord, what happened to that poor thing? (trails off) Oh dearie me...

You see, doc... or is it nurse? No matter. It's the dizziness, and my head feels like it's spinning in circles. Everything looks hazy, like tryin' to watch TV through a window screen. I get these awful headaches too, like someone's poundin' on my temples with a hammer.

And then there's this... (pauses) Oh, what was the word? Ah yes! Muddled. My mind's all muddled up. Can't think straight no more. Like tryin' to remember where I put my teeth...(laughs nervously) Must've misplaced 'em again!

Wait, now what was it about temperature? Oh dear me... (trails off)

Oh, that's right! Temperature makes it worse. Makes me all lightheaded and dizzy-like. And the heart racin' business... or is it the dizziness? I always get those two mixed up...(laughs again)"
164,drug reaction,"My skin occasionally peels off the rashes that I have. This makes me more vulnerable to infections. My hands begin to shake, and occasionally I have tremors.","My skin... (pauses) You know, I was at the market yesterday, and they had those nice fresh tomatoes... anyway... my skin sometimes peels off from these rashes I get. Can't even remember what it's called... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting old, can't recall names no more! (laughs) It makes me feel a bit exposed, if you know what I mean. More susceptible to infections, I think that's the word. And my hands... they start shaking like a leaf now and then. Not just one hand, both of 'em. Sometimes it gets so bad, I get these tremors... or was it shakiness? (laughs) Oh dear me, got confused there for a sec! Anyway, that's what's been going on with me...","I don't know if you remember me from last time... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's a bother, really. These rashes come and go. Sometimes they're itchy, sometimes they're not. But what gets me is when the skin starts to peel off. (chuckles) Sounds crazy, but think about it like a piece of fruit. When it's ripe, you know it's time to eat it. Same with my skin, I suppose.

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, peeling skin. It makes me more... susceptible, that's the word. More susceptible to infections, I think. (pauses) Or is that... no, I remember now. We talked about it last time, and you said something about... um... what's the name of that disease...? Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue.

Now, let me think for a moment. Hands. That's right. My hands. They start shaking, like this (trembles hand). And then there are these... tremors. Like I'm holding onto something and it's slipping away. (pauses) You know what's funny? When I was a young woman, my grandmother used to have those exact same shakes. I remember thinking how old she must be, because my mom said it was a sign of... well, never mind.

Now, where were we? Ah yes, the shaking hands and tremors. It's been going on for... (pauses) Well, let me see. If I had to count backwards from today... hmm... carry the one... (laughs nervously) Oh dear, it's all a bit fuzzy now.

Anyway... my skin peels off, I get infections more easily, and my hands shake like this. That's about it, I think."
165,drug reaction,I have severe nausea and chest discomfort. I have been having chest discomfort lately. I often shiver a lot and feel really nervous.,"I've been feeling just terrible lately... my stomach's always churnin' like there's a storm in there, you know? Can't even think straight. I get this awful nausea... *pauses* Reminds me of that time I had food poisoning from that new restaurant downtown, Lord have mercy... But anyway, the chest pain. It's been goin' on for... uh... weeks now, or was it months? Time sure flies when you're not payin' attention... *chuckles* My doctor's always sayin', ""Take it easy, take your meds."" But I'm a stubborn one. *pauses again*

Oh, and shiverin'! That's another thing. I get the shakes somethin' fierce. Like I've got ice water in my veins. It's so... unsettling. And then there's this nervous feelin'... like ants crawlin' on my skin. Can't seem to shake it off. *trails off*

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The chest pain. Been havin' that a lot lately too.

(pauses) Ah yes, the chest discomfort. It's been bothering me lately. Not all the time, mind you, just when I'm out in the garden or driving to the grocery store... And nausea? Oh dearie me, it's like my stomach is doing flips on a trampoline! (chuckles)

You see, I was talking to Edna at bingo night and she said her sister had something similar. Now what was it called again? Ah yes, heartburn... no, wait, that can't be right... or could it? (laughs) My cousin George used to have this problem with his esophagus... or was it the gallbladder?

Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now! Anyway... my chest feels... (pauses, searching for words) ...tense. No, that's not it. It feels like there's a rock in there, making it hard to breathe. Sometimes it gets better when I take some of those antacids... you know, the ones with the bubbles? (stares off)

And shivering! Good heavens, I do get cold quite easily nowadays. My wife says it's because I'm getting older and my metabolism is slowing down... or was that her sister's problem again? (shrugs) Oh well, it doesn't matter now. The point is, I feel like I've got a few bees in my stomach, buzzing around, making me all jumpy... and nervous! That's the word: nervous. Like when you're waiting for the dentist to call your name at the front desk... (trails off)"

No matter, anyway... Itchy all over, you see. Can't even sleep at night because of the scratchin'. And then there's this flaky skin business... (pauses) You know, reminds me of when my husband used to get eczema on his elbows. Poor thing would scratch 'til he'd bleed. (chuckles)

Now, these rashes, they're not just plain red spots neither. Sometimes I see markings on my body, like little patches or scales... flaky stuff. It's hard to explain. But it happens a lot, every few days... or is it every week? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all foggy... (laughs) Sorry about that.","Now, let me try... (pauses) I think it started with these rashes, ya see? On my chest, back, everywhere really. Itch all over, makes me scratch myself half to sleep. (stares off into space) My sister used to get eczema, just like that... but no, wait, was it psoriasis? No, I'm sure it was the other one... anyway. (clears throat)

These rashes, they're all flaky and whatnot. Leave these markings on my skin. Like freckles or moles, but not quite right. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, let me think... where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes, the lasagna. My wife always made the best lasagna. (trails off)

Oh, yes! The rashes! They make my skin feel like sandpaper. Can't even sleep at night without itching all over. And then there's this one spot on my knee... (looks down) No, that's not it. I mean... what was the name of that other thing? You know, the one where you scratch and it doesn't help? (sighs)

Anyway, like I said, rashes on chest and back, all over really. Flaky skin with markings. Can't remember when it started exactly... but it's been months now. Months! I swear, my doctor in Florida used to say something about... (trails off again)"

And it's falling out something awful. My scalp feels like the Sahara Desert - dry and itchy. I've been using that new shampoo, but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Dandruff's gotten worse too...

(chuckles to herself)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, hair loss. It started about a year ago, but now it's getting worse. My wife says I look like I'm going bald or something... (trails off) You know what would be nice? A new haircut. I could use one of those fancy buzz cuts. That'd make me feel like a new man...

Oh, and my scalp's always dry. Like the Sahara desert out there. And the itching gets worse when it rains! Can you imagine that? Itching in the rain... (laughs softly) Now, what was it I wanted to tell you about?

Ah yes, dandruff! That's been a problem since... well, since my mom used to use this shampoo on me. (pauses) What was her name again? Maude... no, wait, that's not right. My wife says I'm getting old and forgetful... (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, the dandruff's gotten worse over time. And now my skin's getting all dry too! Like my lips are cracking open... I need to put some more lip balm on. (pauses) Do you have lip balm? I could swear I saw it in your drawer last time...

I think that's everything, dear doctor..."

I don't know if it's the heat, the cold, or maybe it's those new pills I'm takin'. But anyway... 

Where was I? Ah yes! My libido. It's not as strong as it used to be. Now, what else is botherin' me? Oh dear, my head... it's all foggy. Like tryin' to think through a thick blanket. Can't quite put my finger on it, but it feels like I've been hit by a truck! Dizziness, that's the word. Yes, dizziness and disorientation... What was I talkin' about? 

My grandson Jimmy's birthday party last weekend, did I mention that? He had a big ol' cake with... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the flavor again? Ah yes, chocolate! Now where were we?

My granddaughter's birthday is next Wednesday, and her name is... uh, Sarah or Sally, one of the two... (laughs)

It's just been... well, it's just been happening more often than usual. Can't say if it's white or clear, but it's definitely not like my usual... (trails off)

And let me tell you, my emotions are all over the map. One minute I'm as happy as a clam, and the next, well, I just want to (laughs nervously) scream at the TV! Mood swings, that's what they call it, right? Agitation, too... I don't know, maybe that's just a fancy word for being grumpy.

Now, where was I going with this? Ah yes, the discharge. It's been happening about every other day now. Not always, but often enough to be noticed. And sometimes there's blood in it, which is just lovely... (sarcastic tone) not."

My appetite varies, you see. Sometimes I'm ravenous, and other times I just can't seem to eat a thing. I'll be cooking dinner, and suddenly my stomach will start growling like a bear wakin' up from hibernation! (laughs) And then there are the desires... for various things, yes. I've been thinkin' about that new bakery downtown. Their pastries look so good, but I shouldn't have those, too many calories... or is it sugar? (confused) No, no, wait, it's just... what was the word my sister used to say when she ate too much cake? Ah, yes! Sugar overload! (laughs)

Anyway, as I was saying, these desires for various things. Like what, you ask? Well, sometimes I want a big ol' plate of fried chicken, but then other times it's fish and chips or... or (giggles) I don't know, just give me whatever's in the fridge! My husband always says I have good taste, but when did I get so hungry all the time? And my knees ache after walkin', poor things.

Now, where were we? Ah yes, focus and memory. It's just gettin' harder and harder to keep track of things. Like my appointments... I set reminders on my phone, but sometimes I forget to look at 'em. And then there's the medication... (pauses once more) Now, what was it for again? Oh dear, don't mind me, doc. (laughs)

And mental clarity... (hesitates) Well, that's just not somethin' I worry about too much no more. You know how it is when you're gettin' older? Your brain just gets all... foggy. Like tryin' to recall the word for that thingamajig... you know what I mean? (laughs weakly)"

So, like I said, this metallic taste. And not just the taste, but smell too. Everything smells funny now. Even my own kitchen, where I've been cookin' for years... smells different. Like someone poured perfume in there or somethin'. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, let me see...

And then there's these aches and pains. Oh boy, they're bad! Acute muscle and joint pain, that's what the book says. But I knew that already. You know, I used to be able to walk five miles without breakin' a sweat... (sighs) Nowadays, just gettin' outta bed is an adventure. (pauses, lost in thought)

Where was I? Ah yes, dandruff. And it's not just that. My scalp's gettin' all dry and itchy. Like... like sandpaper! No, no, not sandpaper... what's that other thing? (taps foot impatiently) You know, when you're tryin' to get the dirt out of between your toes? (snickers) Oh boy...

And don't even get me started on my skin. It's drier than the Sahara desert! (laughs) I swear, it's like I've been out in the sun too long without a hat... or was that my husband? (giggles nervously)

Anyway... dry skin and hair loss. That's what's goin' on with me. Now, would you like some tea? I made some fresh lemonade just yesterday... (trails off)"

Can't quite put my finger on it...","I don't know if I should be sayin' this, but my desire for... uh... you know what I mean... sex... hasn't been the same lately. It's like, I used to look forward to it with my husband, and now it's just a chore. I'm not interested, ya see? And it hurts when we do try. Oh dear, is that still part of the problem? (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, it hurts.

I get this... fog in the brain, like my mind is muddled. It's hard to focus on things. Simple things, like cookin' dinner or payin' bills... (chuckles) Oh, remember when we used to have those big ol' family dinners? My mother-in-law would always bring her famous seven-layer Jell-O... anyway... brain fog.

And I feel... bewildered. Like I'm walkin' through a room and I don't know how I got there. (laughs) Just like that time at the bingo hall when I thought we were goin' to the early bird special, but it was just the regular game... (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, bewildered.

Now, where's my husband? I could've sworn he was right here. Did I take my medication today? (pauses) I know I did, I think. We had our granddaughter over for dinner last night... she's such a sweetie-pie... reminds me of her mother when she was little... (trails off)

Can't quite put my finger on when it started exactly... after that one trip to see my sister in Florida? No, wait, was it last year or the year before? Oh dearie me!

You see, it's not just that, doc... (stammers) I get these mood swings. One minute I'm as happy as a clam, and the next... well, let's just say I wouldn't want to be on the receivin' end of my temper! (laughs nervously) Irritable, they called it in the Bible, right? (giggles) Oh, Lord have mercy...","I don't know if this is important, but I've been noticing... hmm, let me think for a sec... my monthly cycle's been different, you see. Not as regular, if you know what I mean. And then there's this discharge... unexpected, I'd say. Can't quite describe it, but it's not like normal... if that makes sense.

And the irritability, oh my goodness, it's just... (sighs) You know how sometimes you feel like you're walking around with a chip on your shoulder? Yeah, that's me most days now.

Now, what was it we were talking about again? Oh yes, my periods. It's like they're on a different schedule now. Sometimes it feels like it's been longer than usual since the last one, and other times it's right back to normal. I don't know if that makes any sense... (trails off)

You know, I was at the grocery store the other day, and I saw this nice lady with her grandchildren. They were so well-behaved, just like my grandkids used to be... wait, no, they're all grown up now, bless their hearts! (giggles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the discharge. I'm not sure if it's related or not, but I did go on a trip last month and had some rather... intense interactions with some, uh, enthusiasts. (winks)

She made these huge portions, and I swear, I ate half the turkey by myself! (laughs)

Oh dear, anyway... I was sayin', it's like my stomach's growlin' all the time now. Different urges and appetites, you see? Sometimes I just want a big ol' plate of mashed potatoes, and other times, I'm cravin' for some sorta... salad? (pauses) Wait, what day is it again? Don't get me started on my schedule... (chuckles)

Oh yes, where was I? Ah yes! My weight. It's like I said, I've put on a lot. And now these hunger pangs... can't seem to stop 'em.

Well, doctor, I've put on quite a bit of... you know, extra padding, if you will. (pauses to think) How much did I weigh when I last saw you? Um...

Oh dear, I had those nice shrimp at the church dinner last night and I'm pretty sure I only ate one serving size. But then I looked down at my hands and they were all... all greasy, like I'd been eating a whole bunch of them. (laughs nervously) Maybe it's that new medication you put me on? No, no, I think it was the lasagna at the wedding last weekend. That's right, I remember now. It was so good! My mother used to make it for me all the time... (trails off)

Now where were we? Ah yes, my appetite. Well, doctor, I've noticed that I have these... urges, you know? To eat certain foods at specific times of day. Like when the sun is shining a particular way through the window. It's quite strange, really. And then there are other days when I don't feel like eating much of anything at all. (pauses to think) Unless it's cookies. I always want cookies.

Like last week, I was supposed to pick up my grandkids from school, and I got there at five, but they weren't even out yet... and I kept thinkin' it was Tuesday, but I'm pretty sure it's Thursday now... (chuckles) Oh dear, I get myself all confused sometimes. And then there's the time I couldn't remember my wife's name for a whole day... (pauses) Ah yes, now what was I sayin'?

Can't focus on nothin', just gets all jumbled up in here (taps forehead).","I don't know if I can remember all this... uh, what was I saying? Oh right, my mind's like a... a swamp. Terrible mental clarity, it is. Can't focus on nothing. It's like trying to hold water in your hands, you know? It just slips away. (pauses) Now, where did I put that book on gardening? Ah yes... and I was telling my sister about this new recipe for apple pie... anyway...

Forgetting things, it's a regular problem now. My name, my address, even what day it is sometimes. It's embarrassing, really. (chuckles nervously) Did I ever tell you about the time I forgot to buy eggs? No, no, that was years ago... uh, what was I saying?

Memory, you know? That's a tricky thing. Some things just don't stick. Like my wife's birthday this year... or was it last year? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now...

Trouble remembering things... like when I took that pill for high blood pressure... (pauses) No, no, I think it was the other one. You know, the one with the fancy name... starts with an R or something. (shrugs)

I'm not sure what to do about this, doc. Maybe a new pair of glasses? Or some kind of... (trails off) Oh look! A bird outside the window! (excitedly points)"

Food tastes like cardboard, smells like old socks. No, wait, I remember now! That's what happened to the Johnsons' cat last year. Poor thing.

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my tongue. It's got this... this metal flavor. Not sure how to describe it. Like someone poured a can of tin paint in my mouth. Don't know if that makes sense, but you're a smart fella, doc. You'll figure it out.

Now, what else was I gonna say? Ah yes! The pain. Severe joint and muscular pain's been plaguin' me somethin' awful. Can't even turn my head without wincin'. Reminds me of the time I had to get a new hip... or was that just a dream? Oh dear, I get those sometimes.

You know what I used to love doin'? Gardening! I could spend hours in the garden, tending to my flowers and vegetables. But now... well, it's hard to even bend over without wincin'. My poor back. Oh, for Pete's sake, where did I put that aspirin? I swear, it was right here on the counter...

Anyway, like I said, doc... *chuckles* Don't mind me, just an old fool ramblin' on. This metal taste and smell business has got me all confused. And don't even get me started on these aches and pains... *sigh*"

Always on one side, always like a storm brewin' inside me head. And them tremors... oh my goodness, it's like my whole body's got the shakes. My arms, legs, even my teeth rattle. I've tried to take some of those new-fangled medicine, but nothin' seems to work for long. Then there's this trouble sleepin'. Can't fall asleep till the wee hours, and when I do, it's not restful at all. Just lie there thinkin' about... (pauses) Where did I put my cat? Feline... I remember now!

Not too bad when I'm sittin' still, but get me movin', and it's like a jackhammer in here (taps chest). Can't keep track of what day it is, either.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my skin. It's just that it flakes off, and then I get these colds or... or whatever they are. My sister-in-law got one of them flu things last year, and I think I might've caught it from her... or was it the other way around? (laughs) Oh dear, my mind's as foggy as this medicine cabinet.

No, wait, was it a bar of soap or a liquid? (laughs) Oh dear...

My skin is becoming pretty dry, I'd say. And these patches, they're just so... flaky. It's like when you take the varnish off an old piece of furniture, and it's all crumbly underneath. You know what I mean? (chuckles to herself) Where was I? Ah yes...

Oh dear, now that I think about it, this reminds me of my trip to the shore with the family back in... 1948 or so? Was it '48? Anyway, my skin would get all sunburned and dry from too much sandalwood oil. Now where did I put that sandalwood oil? (pauses) No, no, that's not it at all...

You see what I mean about this hair business... thinning out and whatnot. Just like when the grass is parched in a drought. All dry and brittle. And now my scalp's acting up again... (sighs)

Can't even turn the channel without getting all upset... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting sidetracked. My mood swings, yes, those have been quite... (pauses to collect thoughts) ...unsettling, I suppose you'd say.","I'm sorry doc... or is it nurse? Anyway... my monthly cycle, it's all changed on me. I don't know what's going on with that anymore. One time it was this long, and the next it was just a few days. And then there's this discharge... (pauses) Oh dear, I remember when my sister had the same thing. No, wait, she didn't have anything like that. Or did she? (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the discharge. It's just been coming and going, and it's not even every month now. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's... well, let's just say it's not exactly pink either. (pauses) Did I mention my friend's granddaughter has that condition too? Or was it her daughter-in-law? (laughs)

And then there's these moods of mine... or is it the weather? No, no, it's me! I get so angry sometimes, and I don't even know why. My husband says I'm just being silly, but I feel like... (pauses, struggling to find words) Ah, you know what I mean.

Let me think for a minute... (pauses) My Aunt Edna used to have something similar... or was that my cousin? Oh dear, it's all jumbled up now. But anyway, the point is, I'm getting on in years, and maybe this is just part of being old. You know how it is... (trails off)

Oh, and one more thing! My back has been acting up something awful lately. (pauses) What was that show we used to watch? You know, the one with the lady who had a funny condition? (laughs) Ah dear, I'm all mixed up now..."

Had my granddaughter's birthday cake last week and Lord have mercy, that chocolate frosting... anyway, as I was saying, I'm quite fat now. I mean, it's not just the weight gain, it's these... inclinations, cravings, they call 'em. Yeah, that's right. My doc mentioned it before, said I might be experiencing some... uh, food-related issues. Started having strange urges for sweets and fats, can't seem to stop myself. Like that time at my niece's wedding, had two helpings of the prime rib... (chuckles) And now, all these cravings. What was I saying? Oh yes, it's quite frustrating, really. (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden this spring? Had some lovely tomatoes...","I'm tellin' ya doc, I've gained a lot of weight... um... since when was it? Wasn't it just last year I lost all that weight with them new diet pills? Or was it before that? (pauses) Ah yes, anyway... now I'm as big as a house. Got a bit of an appetite too, which is strange 'cause I used to eat like a bird when my wife was cookin' for me. But now... (chuckles) well, you know how it is.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes! Weight gain! And cravings, oh boy! I've got the most awful inclination towards ice cream, especially that rocky road flavor. Can't get enough of it. My kids say it's because my sugars are outta whack, but I'm not sure what they're talkin' about. Just a minute, let me think... (pauses) Now where did I put my reading glasses?

Oh yes! And these cravings... they come at the most inopportune times too. Like just the other day, I was at church and suddenly I needed a big ol' plate of fried chicken. I mean, what's wrong with me? Used to be able to control this sorta thing... but no sirree, nowadays it's like my body's runnin' its own show. (chuckles) And all these inclinations! Lord have mercy...

Now, did I tell you about the time... (pauses) No, never mind that one. Focus, focus... weight gain and cravings. That's what we're talkin' 'bout here. Don't know how much more of this I can take, doc..."

Try to think about what I need to do tomorrow and... (hesitates) What was it again? Oh yes, take the pills! I have trouble remembering things. And I get these awful headaches. Like a dull ache in my head. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, let me think... What were we talkin' about? (laughs softly) Ah yes, my memory. It's just not what it used to be. (muttering to herself) I wonder if I turned off the stove at home...""","I don't know if you can understand me... (pauses) I was thinkin' about my wife's sister's recipe for chicken soup... you know, that one with the potatoes and carrots? (chuckles) Anyway... I've been feelin' a bit... foggy. Yeah, that's the word. Foggy. Like I'm stuck in this thick, gray mist and can't see nothin'. My mind just won't focus. I'll be sittin' there watchin' TV, and suddenly I forget what day it is or what we had for dinner last night... (laughs) What a fool I am! 

I was at the market yesterday, and I saw this young fella with a cart full of produce. Now, I'm sure he was my son, Tom, but he said his name was Steve? (pauses) Wait, that's not right... Must've been another time... (trails off)

Oh, dear me! Focus, focus! What was I sayin'? Ah yes, memory. That's it. It's just... gone. Vanished into thin air like my keys every morning... or sometimes I find 'em in the strangest places. Like that one time I left 'em at the library... (chuckles) Library? No, no, no! It was... uh... 

Anyway, this fog... it's been goin' on for weeks now. Months? Time's all jumbled up like a mess of yarn in a ball... What year is it, anyway? (laughs nervously)

Sorry, sorry, I'm gettin' sidetracked. The important thing is my memory and concentration. That's what's the problem. Or is it my blood pressure? I always worry about that... (mutters to self)"

(laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting sidetracked. And my joints, oh boy... (groans) Pain in my hands, knees, shoulders... feels like someone's beating me with a hammer. Excru-ciating!

And I thought, ""Hmm, this tastes a bit... off."" Not that it's ever been perfect, mind you, but now it's like... metal. Yes, metallic. Can't quite explain it. Reminds me of the time I went to the dentist, Dr. Johnson, and he gave me one of those numbing shots... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, taste. It's just not right.

Now, about this pain... (pauses, collecting thoughts) My joints, my poor old body. Can't even walk without it screaming at me. And these... these muscles... feel all tight and achy. I swear, sometimes it feels like someone's taken a baseball bat to them. I had that once, you know? The dentist hit my tooth with the drill, oh dear Lord. (chuckles nervously) Ah, yes, pain.

Metallic taste, you see... can't quite shake it. Reminds me of that time I ate that tin foil for lunch, thought it was a sandwich... (laughs) Oh dear, silly me. Anyway... I'm getting old, I suppose. Too many creaky joints and wonky taste buds... (pauses) Now, where did I put my tea cup?"

And sleep, oh dear lord, I haven't been sleeping well at all. Can't seem to get comfortable, even after trying that new mattress I got from... uh... what's-his-name's store. (pauses) Oh, and my muscles, they just shake and shiver like a leaf! (laughs) And then sometimes I feel lightheaded, dizzy-like. (taps foot impatiently) It's quite the bother, doctor...""","I'm gettin' these headaches, doc... or was it the migraines? Oh dear, I always get those mixed up. Anyway, I've been havin' a real time tryin' to sleep at night. Can't seem to settle my mind no matter how hard I try. My poor husband says I'm snorin' somethin' fierce now... (chuckles) Excuse me, what was the question again? Ah yes, headaches.

It's like there's a weight on my head, you know? And these migraines... (pauses) Now where did I put that recipe book? I swear it was right here on the kitchen counter. Oh dear, anyway... Like I was sayin', I've been havin' all sorts of tremors and shiverin's, especially in my hands. My grandkids said they used to have those when they were little. I think I remember that from when I was a child myself... or was it just on TV? (laughs) Oh dear me...

And then there are these dizzy spells. Lightheadedness, is that the right word? I get up too quick and my head starts swimmin', like in them old-fashioned paintings of mermaids. What's that called again, when you feel... (snaps fingers) what was it? Oh yes! Dizziness! And I'm afraid I might be forgettin' things too. My mind's like a... a... well, you know how it is when you can't find your keys and you're sure they were right here on the table. Now that's... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! Headaches..."

(pauses) My sister Edna always said we shouldn't mess with those new-fangled thermometer things... anyway... I feel quite nauseous and lightheaded, it's like my whole body is sinking down into the floor. (chuckles) And let me tell you, my heart's pounding something fierce. Like a jackhammer, just nonstop. And my mind, well... it's foggy as a June morning after a heavy rain. I'm having some trouble thinking straight, doctor. It's like trying to grasp a handful of sand – the harder I try, the more it slips away from me. Wait, what was the date again? Wasn't it just yesterday we went over my... uh... my... you know... (trails off)","You know, I was talking to my sister-in-law the other day... anyway... so when I get one of them temperatures, you see, it's like my whole body just decides to go haywire. Nausea hits me right in the gut, and I feel like I'm gonna pass out or something. Lightheadedness, that's what they call it, right? 

Oh dear, where was I going with this? Ah yes... my heart starts racing like a jackrabbit, all pounding and whatnot. And then there's this foggy feeling in my head... (pauses to think) I think it's been happening for years now... but anyway... it's hard to put into words. You see, everything feels kinda hazy, like looking through one of them old milk bottles you used to find on the side of the road. 

Wait a minute... wasn't that the day my daughter got married? I remember we had these lovely garden seats set up for everyone... Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes... now where did I put those keys? (chuckles) Oh dearie me...

Oh, and then there's this thinking part. Now, you'd think it wouldn't be too hard to think straight when your body's feeling like it's turned against you, but no sirree... it's like trying to remember the alphabet backwards while someone's tapping their foot real fast next to my ear... (laughs) Oh dear...

Anyway, so this foggy head business makes it mighty difficult for me to get anything done. It's like trying to put together a puzzle blindfolded, you know? (pauses to collect thoughts) Or was that a jigsaw puzzle? Ah well, doesn't matter now."
197,drug reaction,"My rashes occasionally cause my skin to start to fall off. I'm more likely to get ill as a result. My hands occasionally start to tremble, and I start to shake.","Oh dear doctor... (pauses) My rashes, they come and go, you see. Sometimes my skin starts to fall off, yes... (chuckles) Like when I was a young'un, we'd get these awful eczema patches on our knees. Reminds me of Aunt Edna's sister, poor thing had the worst case of dry skin this side of the Mississippi. (pauses) Now where was I? Ah yes, my rashes... They cause me to get more poorly, that's for sure. My immune system just can't seem to keep up.

(whispers) I've been taking them new pills, what were they called again? The ones with the fancy name... (pauses) Oh dear, it starts on my hands! My hands begin to tremble and shake like a leaf. Just like that time at the church social when... (trails off)

Oh, right! My hands. Yes, that's when I get these awful tremors. (pauses again) Now what was the word you were trying to tell me about? The ones for my skin?","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right, but... (pauses) My rashes, they come and go like my cousin Edna's gossipin'. Can't remember how long it's been since last time, but... (hesitates) They start on my arms, usually. And my skin, it starts to fall off in places. Like scabbing, I suppose. But not just a little bit, no sir. It's like whole patches, flakin' off like autumn leaves. (chuckles)

Now, after that happens... (pauses) I get so weak, can't even pick up the newspaper without gettin' winded. My doctor – no, not this one, my old doc from back in '67 – told me it's because my immune system's shot to pieces. Can't keep nothin' inside for long. Fever, aches... You name it, I've had it. Don't know what's causin' all these rashes, but...

And then there's these shakin' spells. (stammers) Hands, feet... like Parkinson's, but not that bad, I don't think? Can't hold onto the phone, can't even write my own name no more. My granddaughter said somethin' about it bein' a sign of diabetes, but... (pauses) Wait, what was we talkin' 'bout again?

Oh, and another thing – my trembles are connected to those rashes, I'm sure. If I get too many cold sores on my hands... (stares off into space) You know, when I used to go fishin', my hands would shake somethin' fierce after the first beer. Same kind of feelin', but now it's more like my whole arm is wobbly as a bowl of Jell-O. (chuckles) Sorry, what was I sayin'?"

I'm not too sure, time just slips away on you when you're watching TV all day. Anyway, this pain in my chest... it's like a squeezing feeling. And the nausea! Oh boy, I feel like throwing up just thinking about it. (pauses) You know, I remember my wife used to make me chicken soup when I had the flu once... anyway... (clears throat)

It's been quite bad lately. My chest really hurts, and I get these trembles... all over! (demonstrates with hands) Like this. And anxiety... I just can't seem to calm down.

No, no, not just my chest, my whole body shakes like a leaf. Trembles, I mean. That's what I said, trembles. (pauses) You know, when I was young... we'd take the streetcar downtown, and it would shake so much I thought it'd fall apart on us. (chuckles)

Anyway, this... chest pain, yes, that's what it is. And my stomach, Lord have mercy, it's like a rollercoaster in there. Nausea, they call it? No, no idea what that means, but it sounds right. (hesitates) You see, I had some of those pills for... uh... (pauses again) ...for heart problems, I think? Yes, heart problems. But now my head's all mixed up about them.

I get so anxious, dear doctor... (gulps) I mean, you're the doctor, aren't you? (laughs nervously) Anxious, yes. Can't sit still, can't sleep at night. My mind's awhirl like a tornado. Now, what was it again? Ah yes, my chest. It pains me when I breathe, and... and other times too. When I'm eating, that is. And sometimes it feels so tight...

Sometimes my skin's so dry, it flakes off like snowflakes in January... remember that time I went to Florida with my sister, Edna? She had the most beautiful garden full of azaleas... anyway...

My grandson says my skin looks like the surface of a cake that's been left out too long. Dry and crumbly. And those stains! Oh boy, they're a sight. I try to wear dark clothes just so nobody sees 'em, but still... what day is today, by the way? Monday? No, wait... Thursday?","I'm so sorry, Doctor... (pauses) I think I had a sandwich for lunch... no, wait, was that yesterday? Oh dear, my mind's like a sieve nowadays. Anyway... 

You see, Doc, it started with this... (clears throat) itching. Everywhere! Not just on one spot, no sir. It's all over – arms, legs, back, chest... even between the toes. I know that sounds silly, but trust me, it's like someone's sprinkling sugar all over my skin. And then there are these rashes... (pauses to think) what was I saying? Ah yes, rashes! On my back and chest, they're red and sore. Sometimes they get dry and flaky, like the winter air in our old farmhouse back home. 

My niece, God bless her, she loves those fancy face masks. I tried one once... didn't help much, though. (chuckles) Now, where was I? Ah yes! The stains. You know, from the flakes and whatnot. It's quite embarrassing, if you must know. My granddaughter asked me why I smelled like a mix of old socks and wet earth... (laughs nervously). Well, that's probably not relevant to your examination, but...

Now, let me think for a moment... have I taken my medicine? (pauses) Goodness gracious, what day is it today?"

I remember my mother used to have... (pauses) Wait, what was I saying? Ah yes! My sister had something similar when she was pregnant with her first child. Maybe I'll tell you about that later. (giggles)

As I was sayin', at night... this burning sensation comes back. Like a stomachache or cramp, but no pain exactly. More like... (pauses) Do you have one of those calendars on your desk? 'Cause today's the 14th, isn't it?

Where was I? Ah yes, symptoms! So, I get heartburn, indigestion, and this nausea sometimes. Like after eating beans or tomatoes or something. But not always. Can be in the morning too... when I wake up from a nice nap, you know? (laughs softly)"

This bloatin', you know, like a big ol' balloon in my belly. And then there's this unease... can't quite put my finger on it. Like somethin's eatin' away at me. Now, let me think... what was the date of my last weigh-in? Was it last week? Or two weeks ago? Ah, shoot, I'm gettin' all mixed up. Anyway, I've lost a few pounds, and I just can't seem to eat no more. Nothing sounds good to me. Sometimes I do see some dark stuff in the toilet... you know, like coffee grounds or somethin', but it's not from my morning coffee, if you catch my drift. And then there was that one time... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the name of that medication I'm on? Ah yes, the little blue ones... I took 'em for high blood pressure. But I digress. There's also been some blood in my vomit...

It started a while back. I'd be feelin' all bloated and uneasy, like my stomach's achin'. And then there's this weight loss, not that I'm complainin', but my clothes are gettin' looser than they used to be. (laughs) And food? Forget about it! Lost me appetite, just can't seem to... (pauses again)

Now, sometimes – not all the time, mind you – I'll have these dark stools. You know, like coffee grounds or somethin'? (pauses once more) Now, where did I put that recipe book? My late husband, God rest his soul, he used to make the most wonderful... (sighs)

Oh yes! The blood in my vomit! (hesitates) That's what really got me worried. All that blood and then this tarry stuff... It's like nothin' I've ever seen before!

And another thing – (chuckles) excuse me, Doc – I have these constant burps. It's like my body just can't help itself. They're loud ones too... (laughs softly) Ah, bless my soul... Sorry 'bout that...

My tummy feels bloated somethin' fierce, like a big ol' balloon in here... (taps belly). And this sour taste? Shoot, it's been there for ages! I mean, it's like someone poured lemon juice right down me throat. Ugh! Just thinking about it makes me shudder.

Been gettin' 'em for weeks, maybe months. And then there's the blood loss, of course. Losin' iron, too. Doctor said I had anemia... *pauses again* Now, where did I put my reading glasses? Oh dear me!

Ah yes, my stool, it's been bloody. You see, I've had this one episode after eating that fancy sandwich from the deli down the street. I think it was a chicken salad or something. No, no, wait, I remember now. It started when I got back from Florida last year. (pauses again) Oh dear, what was I sayin'?

Oh yes, bloody stools! And then there's the... uh, you know, loss of blood. Which led to a reduction in iron levels, I'm pretty sure that's right. Doctor said something about anemia, but I don't rightly remember... (trails off) You know what's funny? My grandkid told me they got that new TV show where the main character has anemia and he can't even walk without gettin' tired. (chuckles)

Anyway, now I'm feelin' just awful all over. Weakness in my legs, arms... (sighs) You know what I was thinkin'? We should've gone to that nice park today like we planned. The one with the big ol' oak tree? No, no, not the one. But you know, I did see a nice bird there once... Oh dear me.

As I was sayin', weakness in general. And it's been goin' on for weeks now. (pauses again) Now, where did I put my teeth? Ah yes! So anyway, the anemia and iron loss... and I'm just feelin' so... (sighs) ...so very tired all the time.

You know, we should've gotten that new fridge last week like I said. It's been actin' up somethin' fierce. And have you seen my bookshelf? I swear, someone was in here rearrangin' my books again... (trails off)"

And after meals, this... this bloating and gas, oh my goodness... feels like I've eaten a whole bag of beans. Uncomfortable is an understatement. You know, just yesterday... or was it last Tuesday?

It's like... it's like... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! The hunger. It's always there, like a nagging voice in my head.

Now, the other thing is these cramps. Abdominal cramps, I think that's what they're called. They come and go, but when they do...

Anyway, like I said, these cramps come and go. And then there's the bloating. Oh dear, it's just awful! My belly gets all swollen up, and I feel so... so... uncomfortable. Like I'm going to burst or something. (laughs nervously)

And after meals, which is always, by the way... (pauses) Did I tell you about my grandkids? They're such a handful sometimes. Anyway, after meals, there's just this awful feeling of fullness. Bloating and gas, that's what it is. And it's like... it's like my insides are churning and whirling around in circles. Unnecessarily, if you ask me.

(Sighs) I'm getting old, I guess. My body's just not working right anymore. (chuckles wistfully) Those were the days..."
205,peptic ulcer disease,"I have changes in my bowel movements, such as constipation and diarrhea. I have a loss of appetite and energy and often feel very fatigued","You know, I've been noticing... changes. In my bowel movements, that is. Constipation, diarrhea... all over the place. I mean, sometimes I go for days without moving my bowels, and then suddenly, it's like a floodgate opens up. And don't even get me started on food... (pauses) I'm not hungry no more, no sir. Used to love cooking, you know? My late wife, God rest her soul, she was the one who did most of the cooking. I think it was last Tuesday... or was that Thursday? Anyway... energy's gone too. Fatigued all the time. Can't even watch TV without dozing off. (chuckles)","I don't know if I should even... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, here they are. Okay, so my bowel movements, well, they're just not right anymore. (clears throat) Constipation and diarrhea, that's what the doctor said last time, anyway. Or was it gas? I always get those two mixed up... (chuckles)

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my gut. It's been like this for a while now. Can't go to the bathroom when I need to, or else it's just too frequent. And don't even get me started on the... (pauses) Oh dear, what were we talking about again? (laughs)

Oh yes! The food. I've lost my appetite, you know? Nothing tastes good anymore. Or is that just because of this new medication the doctor prescribed for... for... (trails off) Oh dear, what's it called?

And energy, nope, none of that either. I'm always tired, even after a nice long nap in the afternoon. (yawns) You know, when you're my age... (pauses) Wait, where did I put my walker? Ah yes, here it is.

Now, let me think for a moment... (taps chin) I had some trouble with my bowel movements, too, back when I was on the other medication. Was it that one or the other that caused it? (shrugs) Oh dear, it's all just a jumble now...

Fatigue, yes... fatigue is what we were talking about, wasn't it? Or was it the constipation and diarrhea again? Ah well, never mind. I'm sure you'll figure it out, doctor..."
206,peptic ulcer disease,I have abdominal pain and it gets only worse if I bend over or lie down. I feel discomfort when I eat certain foods such as spicy or acidic food. Sometimes I get loose stools because of this,"Abdominal pain... been going on for, um, I think it was last week? No, wait, was it this week? Anyway, it hurts when I bend over or lie down, you know. Makes me feel like I'm gonna, uh, twist my gut in two. And food, oh boy, certain foods make it worse. Spicy stuff, acidic... can't even think of that one thing... Tom Yum soup! Yeah, that's the one. Can't have that no more. And then sometimes, well, you know how it is when you're eating too much fiber? I get loose stools. Been having those for a few days now.","I don't know if I should be sayin' this, but... (pauses) Oh dear, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Pain in the middle, you see? (taps chest) Like someone's got a hold of it and won't let go no more. And gettin' worse when I bend over or lie down, oh boy... (gulps)

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, food! Certain foods, that is. Spicy, I mean, they make me feel like my gut's on fire, Lord have mercy... Can't even think about eatin' them no more. And don't even get me started on acidic stuff... (pauses to collect thoughts) What was the word I wanted? Ah yes, tomatoes! Tomatoes are bad for me now... Think it's the seeds or somethin'.

You know, my brother used to have this problem too... Something with his stomach, he had to go see a specialist. (trails off) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?

Oh, and then there's these loose stools, bless my soul! Must be from the food, I reckon. (chuckles nervously) Can't remember if it's every time or just sometimes... You'd think I'd know by now, but no sir... My mind's gone blank like a... (pauses, searching for words) like a... Oh dear!

Now, let me get back on track. The pain, it comes and goes, but when I'm eatin', it's like my stomach's doin' the Texas two-step! Can't take it no more..."
207,peptic ulcer disease,I have difficulty sleeping due to abdominal pain or discomfort. I have a loss of appetite and feel fatigued after going to the bathroom. I feel very tited all the time,"""Oh dear, doc... um, you know my daughter came by yesterday and she brought me those nice cookies, I just love her baking... anyway, where was I? Oh right, sleeping. It's been a problem for weeks now, ever since... hmm, when did I have that stomach trouble again? Was it last month or the one before? Ah yes, abdominal pain. It hurts after eating and I wake up with this gnawing feeling in my tummy. Can't seem to get comfortable at night. I try to go to bed early, but then... you know how some days just drag on? And when I do go to the bathroom, I'm so tired afterwards. Just feels like all energy's drained out of me. Feels very tired, all the time. Don't know what's wrong...""","I'm so sorry, Doctor...

Oh dear, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, here they are. Now, let me think about this... (pauses to collect thoughts) I have a loss of appetite... no, not exactly a loss, more like... you know how sometimes you're not hungry at all, but then when you do eat something, it feels like lead in your stomach? That's what I mean. And after using the bathroom... (hesitates again) well, if I'm being honest, Doctor... I feel just... drained. Completely fatigued. Can't seem to muster up the energy for anything.

Tired all the time, you see. Always have been a bit of an early riser, but now even getting out of bed feels like climbing Mount Everest. (chuckles) Ah, good times! When I was younger... anyway... where was I? Ah yes, tired. And that bellyache... it's been there for weeks, months... no, longer than that, I think. Years? No, no, not years... (trails off)"
208,peptic ulcer disease,I have a sour acidic taste in my mouth. I have frequent belching and burping. I have a feeling of pressure or fullness in my upper abdomen that last for a few hours,"""Oh dear, doctor... I've been feeling just terrible lately. You see, I woke up this morning with a sour acidic taste in my mouth. Just like lemon juice, it is. Made me pucker up just thinking about it. (pauses) Now, where was I? Ah yes, the taste... anyway, it's been there all day, on and off. Sometimes it goes away for a bit, but then it comes back. Like my old cat, Mr... uh, what was his name again? Oh dear, it'll come to me in a minute.

""Anyway, I've also been belching and burping nonstop. Just terrible. My stomach feels like it's going to burst. Fullness, pressure... you know how it is when your stomach's doing flips? That's what it feels like. For hours on end. (pauses) Did I tell you about my trip to the park last week? Such a lovely day... We saw some ducks, and I even got a nice nap in. Oh dear, where was I again?""","I'm gettin' this sour... acidic... taste in my mouth. You know what I had for lunch? Egg salad sandwich. I love egg salad sandwiches. Reminds me of my wife, God rest her soul, she used to make them for me all the time... (pauses) Ah yes, the sour taste. Like someone poured lemon juice right down my throat.

And the belchin', doc, it's nonstop! I sound like a cow in here. I was at the diner yesterday, and I had a big ol' burger... no, wait, that wasn't yesterday... anyway, after lunch, I started feelin' this pressure... or fullness... up top, ya know? Like someone's sit-tin' on my stomach.

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? (laughs) Oh dear, it's like tryin' to find a needle in a haystack! Ah yes, the pressure. It lasts for hours, doc. Hours and hours. I'll be doin' somethin', watchin' TV or readin' the paper... and suddenly, whoosh! That ol' feelin' comes back.

Now, where was I? Oh yes, the belchin'. Like I said, it's nonstop. My friends say I'm like a fountain in here. (chuckles) I don't know what's causin' it, but I'm worried... you're a smart doctor, you'll figure it out.

By the way, have you seen my favorite fishing hat? I could swear I left it right here on the couch..."
209,peptic ulcer disease,I have unintended weight loss and difficulty gaining weight. I have pain and discomfort that is relieved by taking antacids. My mouth tastes very bad,"I've been losin' weight, doc... don't know how much more I can take. Can't seem to put on a pound, even when I'm eatin' like a horse. And this stomach pain, it comes and goes... usually after breakfast, but sometimes at night too... or is that the other way around? (pauses) Oh, dearie me, where's my tea? Ah yes...

Anyway, like I was sayin', it hurts somethin' fierce, especially after I eat... don't know if it's gas or what. But takin' them Rolaids helps a lot. Relieves the discomfort right away... usually within an hour or two. (trails off) Now, let me think... my granddaughter's birthday party was last weekend... or was that the week before? Hmm...

And, doc... have you ever had to deal with a mouth full of sores? Mine tastes awful all the time... like someone poured acid in my mouth. Can't even enjoy a nice cup of tea without makin' a face... (chuckles) Guess I'll just have to stick to water from now on!","I'm sorry doc, I'm havin' some trouble with... uh... weight, yeah? I've lost a lot of weight lately, don't know how much exactly, but my clothes are gettin' looser by the day. And it's not like I'm eatin' any less or nothin', if anything I think I might be... (pauses) you know what would taste good right now? A nice slice of pecan pie from down at the diner. Mmm, their pecans are just so... crunchy.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, weight loss. And it's not just that, I'm havin' some discomfort in my... (taps stomach) you know, here. Painful, it is. Burning, I think. Or is it a gnawin' feelin'? Can't quite put my finger on it. But when I take those antacid tablets... (pauses to remember) what are they called again? Ant-... something-or-other... Ah yes! Tums! They seem to help the pain go away for a bit.

But that's not all, doc. My mouth... (makes a face) tastes terrible, like someone poured a bottle of vinegar in there or somethin'. Can't even stand the thought of eatin' nothin' without takin' some water first. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Weight loss and this... other thing... Discomfort? Pain? Oh dear, my mind's a bit of a muddle today."
210,peptic ulcer disease,"Occasionally throughout the day or at night, I have burning in my upper abdomen. I get indigestion, heartburn, and frequent bouts of extreme nausea.","Burning in my upper abdomen... you know what I had for breakfast this morning? Oatmeal with raisins. No, wait, was that lunchtime? Oh dear, I get mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this burning sensation, it comes and goes. Sometimes at night, like last night, but also during the day, like yesterday afternoon when I... (pauses) what was I doing yesterday afternoon again? Ah yes, watching TV with my grandkids! That's right.

This burning, though... it feels like acid or something. Makes me cough sometimes. And then there's this indigestion and heartburn business. Always seems to hit me after a big meal. Like when we went out for dinner last week... (trails off) Oh dear, was that my friend Edna I had dinner with? Anyway...

Frequent bouts of nausea too. Makes it hard to eat sometimes. (pauses, looks around the room) Where's my reading glasses? Ah yes... (clears throat) As I was saying, these symptoms come and go. Not sure what triggers 'em exactly. (hesitates)","Oh dear doctor... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my cousin Edna... no, wait, that's not right... his name is Elmer... anyway... my stomach. Yes, my stomach. It's been acting up something fierce. (chuckles)

Burning sensation in the upper abdomen, yes... during the day, sometimes at night too. I don't know if it's the same as heartburn or whatnot, but it feels like a fire inside me. (pauses to collect thoughts) You see, I was trying to remember when this started... was it after that big dinner party? No, no... I'm getting ahead of myself.

Indigestion, yes... I get those acid reflux episodes too. It's always at night, usually when I'm lying in bed. (stares off into space) Did I tell you about the time I accidentally set the curtains on fire with a candle? Oh dear, my late husband... he always said to be more careful...

And then there's this nausea... oh boy, it's like my stomach is doing flips inside me. Frequent bouts, that's what I call 'em. (laughs nervously) I've tried some of those Tums tablets, but they don't seem to help much.

You know, I swear, Edna (or was it Elmer?) had something similar... or was it just a stomachache from eating too many beans? Hmm... my mind's a jumble today. Anyway, doctor dear... (stares at the ceiling) Ah yes! It's that burning sensation again. Must get to the bottom of this..."
211,peptic ulcer disease,"Bloating and unease are both present in me. I've been losing weight and losing interest in food. I occasionally get tarry, black stools and vomit that contains blood.","Doc, I'm gettin' all puffy, you know? Bloating and whatnot. Can't believe my sister Edna used to have that too... (pauses) Now, where was I? Ah yes, bloating. And I feel uneasy, like a knot in my stomach. Been losin' weight, even though I'm eatin' less, if you can imagine that. My nephew says I'm lookin' skinnier, but I don't feel any better. Food just doesn't taste right no more... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time we went to the beach and I got a sunburn on my nose? Ouch! Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, weight loss. And it's not just that. Sometimes... sometimes I get these tarry stools. You know, black as coal. Don't like thinkin' about it, if you don't mind me sayin'. And then there's the vomiting. (hesitates) When did this start happenin', exactly? Was it after my sister's birthday party or before? Hmm...","You know, I've been feelin'... (pauses) ...funny. Bloating, that's what they call it, right? Yeah, I get bloated, like after eatin' beans or somethin'. But not just that. It's more than that. Unease, yeah, that's the word. I wake up in the middle of the night, feel like... (pauses again) like my stomach's churnin', you know? Like it's got a life of its own.

And then there's the weight loss. (muttering to self) I swear, I used to eat more than this... Now, I don't know, maybe I'm just gettin' older. My mother-in-law, God rest her soul, she was always sayin'... (trails off)

Oh, right! The food. I lost interest in food. Don't get me wrong, I still like a good steak or some mashed potatoes every now and then. But nothin's really soundin' good to me lately.

(Chuckles) Now, what was it called? Ah yes... tarry stools. My friend Edna had that once. It was from drinkin' too much coffee, if I recall correctly. (pauses) Anyway... those black stools. And the vomiting... with blood. (pauses again) That's just not right.

I remember my cousin's wife had some kind of stomach problem... wasn't it an ulcer? No, no, that's not it. Her husband said somethin' about ""gastritis""... I think? Maybe that's what I got. Or maybe I just need to eat more fiber...

Anyway... (trails off) Oh dear, I hope I'm not forgettin' anything important..."

Food gets stuck in my throat, like it's tryin' to go down a straw or somethin'. Bloating too - feel like I'm gonna pop. Can't stop belchin', and that sour taste... ugh!

So, it feels like food is gettin' stuck in my throat all the time... like it's just sittin' there, you know? And I feel bloated, too. Constantly. Belchin', belchin' away. My stomach's always grumblin'. (pauses to collect thoughts)

And then there's this sour taste in my mouth... (sighs) Like someone poured lemon juice straight into it. Can't seem to get rid of it no matter what I eat or drink. Now, I know I've been feelin' a bit... (hesitates) off... lately. Fatigue, you see? But I'm not sure if that's related to this throat business... or maybe it's just the cold weather...

Ah yes, here it is... Anyway, as I was saying, these bloody stools have been a real nuisance... (trails off)

And all the iron I've been losing... my goodness gracious, I swear I used to have a decent amount of hemoglobin in me bones... now I'm always feeling like I'm going to pass out... weak as a kitten, if you know what I mean.

Mmm... speaking of kittens, I had one once. Whiskers was her name... lovely little thing... (starts to reminisce) Oh dear, where's my teeth? I need to brush them, don't I? Ah yes, now where were we?

Right, the anaemia! Yes, that's what they called it at the hospital. They gave me some pills and said to come back for a follow-up... but I'm not even sure if I took those pills... (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I get so confused sometimes...

What was that medicine they gave me last time? The one for... uh... you know, for my stomach? No, it wasn't that one... (sighs) I'm gettin' old, Doc. My brain's not what it used to be..."
218,peptic ulcer disease,"My mouth is filled with a sour, acidic flavour. My burping and belching are frequent. For a few hours, I get pressure or fullness in my upper belly.",".. you know what they say about too much coffee, it's like my stomach's doin' flips. My mouth's got this... this sour taste, like lemons or vinegar, I'm not sure which. It's like my tongue's coated with somethin'. And the burps, oh boy! They just keep comin', one after another. Don't know what's causin' it, maybe that new medication I started last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Shoot, can never keep track... anyway. And then there's this pressure in my upper belly, like someone's tryin' to squeeze the life outta me. Only lasts a few hours, but when it hits, boy, you feel it. Must be my stomach actin' up again, I swear.","I'm so sorry, doc... I think it started a few days ago... my mouth feels like it's been dipped in vinegar or something. Sour, acidic flavour all the time... (pauses) You know what's funny? My cousin Edna used to have that same problem when she was taking those newfangled heartburn pills. No, wait, that's not right... (chuckles)

Anyway, my burping and belching are just awful. I mean, I've always been a bit gassy, but this is something else. My stomach feels like it's about to burst... or maybe it already has? (laughs nervously) Ah, silly me.

Now, the pressure in my upper belly... that's what really gets me. It comes and goes, you know? Like clockwork. A few hours, then it's gone again. But the sour taste stays with me all day. I've tried drinking water, but that just makes it worse. And don't even get me started on food. (pauses to collect thoughts)

I remember my grandmother used to make this wonderful soup... beets and potatoes... and it always helped with her stomach problems. Now, where did I put that recipe? (rummages through mental drawers) Oh dear, I think I might've given it away... or was it my sister who took it?

What was I saying again, doc? Ah yes, the pressure in my belly. It's just so... uncomfortable. And sometimes it feels like it's moving up into my chest... (pauses, takes a deep breath) Excuse me, what's that noise outside? Sounds like someone's mowing the lawn... anyway..."
219,peptic ulcer disease,I lose weight unintentionally and find it challenging to acquire weight. I use antacids to ease the pain and discomfort I experience. My mouth feels horrible.,"Doc, you see... I lose weight, unintentional like, and I just can't seem to put on any extra pounds. It's a real nuisance, if you know what I mean... (pauses) You know, my cousin Edna had a similar problem when she was younger, but it turned out to be something with her thyroid... or was it her stomach? Ah, yes, the stomach! Anyway...

I take antacids, Tums, whatever's on sale at the pharmacy. They help with the discomfort, but it comes back, you know? And my mouth feels just awful. All dry and sore. I've been using that toothpaste with the fluoride in it... (trails off) Did I tell you about the time I accidentally superglued my shoes together? Ha! Good grief...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the weight loss. It's been going on for months now, maybe years even. My daughter says I look a bit gaunt, but I just think it's this stomach business... (chuckles)","I don't know if this is what's goin' on, but I swear I used to weigh... hmm, when did I say that? Oh dear, my mind's a blank slate nowadays. Anyway, I've been losin' weight for no reason! Just eatin' the same things, and suddenly I'm skinnier. Can't seem to put on an ounce, either. I try to gain weight, but it just slips right off me like sand between my fingers.

Now, about this... uh, stomach issue of mine. You see, I take those antacids for my heartburn. Been takin' 'em for years now. My son says I should switch to some new kind, but I like these ones. Familiar, you know? (pauses) Now where did I put that recipe book... I could've sworn it was right here...

My mouth feels just dreadful, Doc... no, not the doc, my friend Edna's husband is a doctor... anyway! My mouth. It's all sore and whatnot. Can't eat spicy food like I used to. Reminds me of when I was on that cruise with my sister. Oh boy, those were the days... We danced the night away... what year was it? (chuckles) Never mind.

Where was I? Ah yes! My mouth. Painful, and these antacids don't seem to help much anymore. It's like a burning sensation all the time... You know, kinda like when you eat too many beans and your stomach just... well, that's another story altogether. (laughs)"
220,peptic ulcer disease,"I occasionally have burning in my upper abdomen throughout the day or at night. I get heartburn, indigestion, and regular episodes of severe nausea.","You know, doc... I get this burning in my upper abdomen, just above my navel. It happens throughout the day, sometimes at night too... (pauses) Oh, I was just thinking about that new bakery downtown, they got them croissants... anyway... (clears throat) This burning's been going on for a while now. Heartburn, indigestion, those are the words you use, right? (chuckles) My wife says it's my eating habits... or lack thereof... I mean, I love coffee in the morning, but that can't be good... sometimes the acid... uh, what was I saying? Ah yes, acid reflux... anyway. Then there's this nausea, severe, you know? Like when I'm about to eat something... or after eating something... (laughs) Oh dear, I get confused...","Oh dear... um... (coughs) I've been having this burning in my upper abdomen, you know? It comes on at night sometimes, when I'm lying in bed. Or during the day, when I'm watching TV. (pauses to adjust gloves) I don't know what it is, exactly. My mother used to have something like that... or was it my aunt? Ah yes, my Aunt Edna had stomach problems too. She'd always say it was the tomatoes. No, wait, was it the coffee? Anyway...

Heartburn, indigestion... those are some of the words I've heard, anyway. (chuckles) That doctor on TV said you should avoid citrus fruits. But I like my orange juice in the morning... (trails off)

I get these episodes, like clockwork. My wife says they're regular, but I don't know if that's good or bad. Nausea, she calls it. Me, I just feel queasy. Like when we went to that new restaurant last week and I got food poisoning... (starts to elaborate) Oh boy, was that a mess! But anyway...

It's always in the same spot, this burning sensation... right under my ribs. Sometimes it feels like it's spreading, you know? To my chest or back. (mumbles to self) Must remember to get more fiber... Ah yes, indigestion. That's what I have. Indigestion..."
221,peptic ulcer disease,"I feel bloated and uneasy at the same time. I've been losing weight, and I no longer like eating. I occasionally get bloody vomit and dark, tarry stools.","""Well, you see, Doc... I feel all puffed up and... uneasy at the same time. (pauses) Like after that big dinner I had last week... no, wait, was it the week before? Anyway, I've lost a bit of weight, but I just can't seem to enjoy eating anymore. (hesitates) It's like my stomach's always upset. And then there's this business with vomiting blood. Not often, mind you, but it does happen sometimes... and the stool, oh dear, it's all dark and tarry, just like when I had that other problem... you know, the one with the... uh... (pauses) Ah yes, I remember now! The gallstones. But this is different, I'm sure of it. (chuckles) Now where was I? Oh yes, the vomiting.""","I don't know if I'm tellin' you about this right... or is it Tuesday? Anyway, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Bloating and uneasy at the same time, that's how I'd describe it. You see, my grandma used to get those symptoms when she ate too much beans... (pauses) what was I sayin'? Oh yes! So I've lost weight, but not in a good way. Used to be 120 pounds, now I'm down to... (hesitates) uh... 118? Is that right? And food don't taste the same no more. Can't even stand the smell of my favorite soup. You know, the one with the tomatoes and... (trails off)

And then there's this other thing. Vomitin' blood. Not every day or nothin', just occasional. My sister-in-law had that problem when she was pregnant. Could be related to that, right? But I'm not sure if it's... uh... related to all these other things or what. And the stools... (pauses) dark, tarry... like coffee grounds, my brother said. He used to work at a gas station, remember those filters they use? Same color. Anyway...

(mumbles incoherently for a few seconds)
Wait, where was I goin'? Ah yes! So it's been goin' on for... um... weeks now? Months? Time flies when you're... (stops) Oh dear Lord, my mind's gettin' all jumbled up. You'll have to forgive me, doctor..."
222,peptic ulcer disease,I often feel like food is getting caught in my throat and have problems swallowing. I feel bloated and frequently belch. I constantly have a bitter aftertaste.,"""Uh, doctor... I don't know if this is related, but yesterday I was eating my oatmeal and my grandkid said I looked like a walrus, (chuckles) anyway... where was I? Ah yes, food stuck in my throat. It happens all the time, especially with bread or sandwiches. And after I eat, I just feel so... bloated. Can't seem to burp it out, you know? Fizzles and farts instead of a good belch like I used to have. (pauses) Oh dear, what's the name of that other medication I'm taking...? Ah yes! The one for my blood pressure. Does this have something to do with that? (trails off) And you know who else had trouble swallowing? My sister Edna, God rest her soul... Always complaining about dry food and such...""","Wait, where was I? Oh yes... the food thing. You know, sometimes I feel like it's stuck, gettin' caught in my throat. It's like... uh... like tryin' to swallow a piece of gum or somethin'. And then there's this bloatin', always feelin' all puffy and uncomfortable. Belch, belch, belchin' all day long. I swear, my stomach's got its own radio station playin' nonstop music.

And that aftertaste... Lord have mercy. It's like someone poured a whole bottle of bile into my mouth. Bitter, yeah, that's the word. Can't get rid of it no matter what I drink. Even water tastes funny now. You know what they say about water: ""water's the best thing for what ails ya""... (chuckles) oh boy... anyway...

Now, let me think... when was my last meal? Um... Tuesday? No, Wednesday? Ah, who cares? Point is, it happens often, don't know why. Must be somethin' I ate. Though I did eat that weird-tastin' soup from the can last week... But that's not it, no sirree.

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Oh yes! The food gettin' stuck thing. Sometimes I have to do this... (makes swallowing motion) try and swallow a few times till it goes down. And then there's them belches, like I said, all day long. Don't know if that's related or not. Probably just too many beans last night, ha!

Wait, did we talk about my teeth? They're fine now, thank you for askin', but... (pauses) Hmm, what was it again? Oh yeah! The stomach thing..."
223,peptic ulcer disease,"I've lost a lot of stuff because of my bloody stools, including iron and bloos. Because of this, I now have anaemia and usually feel fairly weak.","I've lost a lot of stuff because of my bloody stools, you know... including iron and blood. Don't even get me started on how I had to replace all those curtains after... (pauses) what was it again? Oh, yes! The cat knocked over the vase... anyway. Because of this, I now have anaemia. My sister-in-law, Edna, she's got that too. Always taking iron supplements. But me, I usually feel fairly weak... all the time, I reckon. Nowadays, I get tired just walking to the kitchen for a cuppa. I swear, my neighbor, Mrs. Thompson, her husband used to be in the military... (chuckles) good fellow, he was. Where was I? Ah yes, weakness... I wake up feeling like I've been run over by a lorry, if you know what I mean.","Oh dear... (pauses) Excuse me, doc... I think I've been having these troubles for a while now... You see, I get these bloody stools... Can't remember when they started exactly, but it's been quite frequent lately... (trails off) Oh, did I tell you about my garden? It's not doing so well this year... too much rain... and then the aphids...

(Stops abruptly) Ah yes, the bloody stools! They've got blood in them, can't deny that... (chuckles nervously) My husband always says ""don't eat that"" but I like a good vegetable soup... anyway... because of these... (pauses to search for words) stool... things... I think it's due to a lack of iron? (hopes) Oh dear, I hope I'm not confusing things...

As I said, my stools are bloody and I've lost a lot of stuff... including iron... and blood... (laughs nervously) I remember when I used to be able to lift heavy baskets without breaking a sweat... now I get tired just walking the dog... And that's when I realized... or was it my sister who said?... I'm anemic. Is that what you call it, doc? An-ee-mic? (pauses for understanding) 

My husband keeps saying ""you need to see a doctor"" but I told him ""I've been seeing them all along""... (chuckles) Anyway, ever since this began... I get weak... fairly weak, like that. Can't recall my daily schedule without taking a nap in the middle of it... can't blame the dog, he's still energetic, you know?"
224,peptic ulcer disease,"My appetite and chronic hunger are both ferocious. My stomach may occasionally ache and spasm. I have gas and bloating after eating, which is really painful.","My appetite and chronic hunger... it's like a bottomless pit, I swear. Ferocious is the word, Doc. I mean, I'm always hungry, all the time. My stomach may ache some days, spasm too... uh, what was that other word? Ah yes, spasms! And sometimes after eating... *pauses* Did I tell you about the time I went to that new diner downtown? Had the most wonderful pancakes... anyway... gas and bloating, oh boy. It's like a fist in my stomach. Painful is one way to put it. I had it this morning... or was it yesterday? Oh dear, these days all blend together. *chuckles* And then there's the, uh, constipation. Yes, that's what they called it at the clinic last time... *trails off*","I'm so sorry to bother you again, doc... but I just can't seem to get a good meal down without feeling like I've eaten a whole elephant. My appetite, well, it's just ferocious. Like when I was younger and my husband, God rest his soul, would take me out for them fancy dinners at the country club... (pauses) Where did we put those pictures of us? Ah yes... anyway...

And then there's this stomach aching and spasming business. Sometimes it's just a little twinge, but other times it feels like someone's stabbing me with a hot knife. I try to take my medicine, but it doesn't seem to do much good no more. And after eating, well... (chuckles) let's just say I'm a bit gassy, if you know what I mean.

This bloating, it's just so painful! It feels like my insides are expanding like one of them party balloons from the 4th of July parade. (pauses, looks around) Now, where did I put that recipe for those sugar cookies? My granddaughter loved 'em...

Oh dear, sorry to get sidetracked... as I was saying, this gas and bloating, it's just awful. And the worst part is, it seems like no matter how much I eat or drink, nothing really fills me up anymore. It's like my stomach's developed a mind of its own. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time we took that trip to the beach? We saw the most beautiful sunset..."
225,peptic ulcer disease,My bowel movements have become constipated and diarrheal. I often feel quite tired and lack both energy and appetite.,"Oh dear...my bowel movements, well, they're all out of whack now. I mean, sometimes it's constipated, and other times it's diarrheal. Can't seem to figure out why. And I'm so tired all the time, you know? My energy's just gone...like my cat when she gets too old to chase mice anymore. (chuckles) Ah, yes! My cat! Anyway...I'm just not hungry no more. No appetite whatsoever. Now what was I saying about my stomach? Oh dear, I think it started last week...or was it the week before that? Time sure flies when you're having fun, don't it?

Now where's my purse...I had something in here for doctor's appointments...oh yes! My medication! Let me see if it's still good. (rustling papers) Ah, no...no, not those ones. Ugh, now what was the question? Oh, right! I'm tired all the time...and constipated...or is that diarrheal?","I don't know if I've been eating too much cheese... you know what I was thinking about just now? My sister's cat, Whiskers. That poor thing used to get so tangled up in my mom's old blankets... (pauses) Oh dear, sorry about that. As I was saying...

My bowel movements, well... they've been a bit of a problem lately. Constipated one day, and then the next day it's like water, if you know what I mean. It's like my insides are all mixed up. And don't even get me started on my appetite... or lack thereof. (chuckles) I used to love cooking, but now even the thought of food makes me tired.

You see, I think it might be that new medication I've been taking for my arthritis. Or maybe it's the fiber supplements? No, no, I'm sure it's not those... although I did have a lovely bowl of prunes yesterday... (laughs) Anyway...

I just feel so... drained all the time. Tired, you know? My legs ache like I've been walking for miles. And my energy levels... well, let's just say I can barely make it from the living room to the kitchen without needing a nap. But that's not the worst of it... or is it? (pauses) Wait, what was I saying?

Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now... My appointment with Dr. Smith... was it last week or two weeks ago? Ah well, does it really matter at my age? (laughs nervously)

Excuse me for a moment, where's that nice nurse who helps you remember things? I always forget what we're talking about..."
226,peptic ulcer disease,"Bending down or reclining down only makes my stomach feel more. I have pain after eating some foods, such as hot or acidic food. I occasionally get loose stools as a result of this.","You know, doc... bending down, that's when it gets worse. Stomach feels like it's gonna turn inside out. And eating certain foods, oh boy... hot stuff, acidic stuff, makes me feel awful. Had a bowl of chili last week, couldn't even finish it. My wife said, ""Why don't you just take some Tums?"" But, you know, I've been taking those for years... (pauses) Now what was the question again? Ah yes, food. After eating that chili, I felt... lightheaded, no, wait, my stomach hurt. And then there's this other thing... loose stools. Just a few days ago, I had some scrambled eggs and... (trails off) Oh dear, what day was it today? Anyway, bending down makes it worse.",".. you see... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm so glad you're here today, Doctor. I've been having the most dreadful time with my stomach lately. You know what they say about old age, right? Can't remember where I put my teeth or what day it is... (chuckles)

Anyway, bending down or reclining down only makes my stomach feel more... well, it's like a knot in there. Can't quite describe it, but it's uncomfortable. Reminds me of that time I visited my cousin in the city and we went to this new restaurant... they had these spicy chicken wings, oh boy! (pauses) Oh dear, I think I might have eaten too much cheese last night...

Yes, yes, food. Eating some foods makes it worse. Hot or acidic foods, you see. Like that tomato soup my daughter made for me last week. Thought it was just a regular old soup, but no... it was one of those new-fangled ones with the spices and whatnot. (trails off)

And then there's this loose stool business. Not every time, mind you, but sometimes after eating those particular foods. Can't quite pinpoint it, but I think it's related to the pain in my stomach. Now, let me see... where did I put my glasses? Ah yes! (looks at notes) Oh dear, I think I was going to say something about a pain after eating...

(continues speaking in a steady stream)

Food, you see. It's like it's attacking me from the inside out. Can't enjoy a nice meal without feeling this... this... (gestures with hands) You know? And then there are these other symptoms... like belching and whatnot. Not exactly related to eating, but still quite uncomfortable. Now, I'm not one for complaining, Doctor, but this is starting to get the better of me. Can we talk about some medication or something?"
227,peptic ulcer disease,"Due to a stomach discomfort, I have problems sleeping or staying asleep. I am exhausted after using the bathroom and lose my appetite. I'm quite nervous all the time.","Doc, I gotta tell ya... I've been havin' these stomach troubles for a while now. Can't sleep worth beans no more. I try to go nighty-night, but my mind keeps racin', like when I was workin' at the factory and we'd get them deadlines comin' up... (chuckles) Oh, you know what I mean? Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, stomach. It's been churnin' all day, makes me tired after using the bathroom... I swear, it's like runnin' a marathon or somethin'. Lost my appetite too, can't eat nothin' without feelin' queasy. Nervous, always on edge... (pauses) You know, I saw that grandson of mine the other day, and he's got them new-fangled headphones on, listenin' to music... what's the name of 'em? Apple something... anyway, where was I? Oh right, nerves. Always feelin' anxious, like my insides are gettin' all jumbled up... (sighs)","I don't know if it's this stomach business... or maybe it's just my age. You know, I was talking to Mabel yesterday, and she said her sister had a similar problem with her stomach. Now I'm trying to remember what we were discussing... oh yes, the garden. My tomatoes are doing all right, but those zucchini plants are just giving me trouble.

Anyway, like I was saying, my stomach's been acting up somethin' fierce. Can't sleep at night, that's for sure. Keeps me up till 2 o'clock in the morning. And then when I do get up to use the bathroom... well, it's like running a marathon or somethin'. I mean, I'm an old man now, but this is ridiculous. You'd think my body would know better than to drain all that energy.

I've lost my appetite, too. Used to love a good plate of spaghetti on Sundays, but no sirree... not lately. Can't even look at the stuff. Nervous all the time, like my nerves are jumping like a wild animal in a cage. Just can't sit still or think straight... unless it's about my cat, Whiskers. She was such a sweet little thing, always purrin' on my lap... what was I sayin'? Oh yes, this stomach of mine. Maybe I'll just take some Tums and be done with it.

(whispers to self) Now where did I put those cookies?"
228,peptic ulcer disease,"A sour, acidic taste is all over my mouth. Belching and burping are common in me. I have pressure or fullness in my upper abdomen for a few hours.","You know, I woke up this mornin', and boy, my mouth was all sour like I'd been suckin' on a lemon. No, no, not just in the morning, but all day, every day now. It's that acidic taste, can't shake it off. And them belches! (chuckles) My wife says I'm gettin' too old for this kind of thing. (pauses) I had my gallbladder out ten years ago... or was it fifteen? Anyway, these belches, they come and go, like the wind. And then there's that pressure in my stomach, like someone's squeezin' a balloon up here (points to upper abdomen). It lasts a few hours, but I don't know exactly how many hours, you see... time just gets away from ya when you're my age...","Well, doc... I don't know if this is important or not, but my mouth feels all sour lately. You know, like lemon juice? Yeah, that's what it tastes like. Sour. And it's everywhere. In my throat, on my tongue... (pauses to think) What was I saying? Oh right.

So, I've been belchin' and burpin' a lot more than usual. My stomach's always been a bit sensitive, but this is different. It's like someone turned up the gas burner in there or somethin'. (chuckles) I remember when my mother used to cook dinner on the stovetop... she'd always leave the gas on too high and it would make the whole kitchen smell like... well, never mind.

Now, where was I? Ah yes. The fullness. It's in my upper abdomen, just under the ribcage. Sometimes it feels like there's a big balloon stuck up in there, waitin' to burst or somethin'. (pauses, looks around the room) You know, I could've sworn we had a cat once... what was its name? Oh dear.

Anyway, this fullness comes and goes, usually after meals. And sometimes at night, when I'm tryin' to sleep. It's like my body's tellin' me somethin', but I don't know what it's sayin'. (trails off) I had a cousin who... no, that's not important.

Now, I know this might sound silly, but I've also been feelin' a bit anxious lately. My heart beats funny sometimes, and my hands get all clammy... just like when I was at the dentist last week! (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I'm gettin' sidetracked again.

Sorry about this, doc... I guess what I'm tryin' to say is that I've got this sour taste in my mouth, and it's makin' me a bit uncomfortable. Can you help me figure out what's goin' on?"

My mouth hurts so much.","Let me tell you, Doctor... (pauses) I don't know why this is happening to me, but I'm losing weight and can't gain it back no matter what. (chuckles) My wife says it's like I'm a bird, always pecking away at my food. (trails off) Oh dear, what was the name of that restaurant we went to last week? You know, the one with the fish fries... anyway...

It hurts so much in here (taps chest). I have to take these antacids all the time, but they only help a little bit. My mouth's been on fire for months now. It's like a burning sensation that just won't go away. (pauses again) What was I saying? Ah yes, the weight... it's been happening off and on since... um... when was my last birthday? Five years ago? Six? (laughs nervously) Oh dear me, what's gotten into me today...","I... uh... what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, my weight. Well, doc, I've been losin' weight, but not on purpose! I mean, I'm tryin' to eat more, really I am. But no matter how much I stuff myself, it just seems like the weight's slippin' right off me. And don't even get me started on the stomachaches. Oh boy, they're killin' me! So I take them antacids... you know, Tums or whatever they're called. They help a little bit, but not enough.

My mouth hurts so much, doc. My teeth, my gums, everything's just... achy. And it's been goin' on for months now. I swear, I used to have the best teeth in the neighborhood! Now, I don't know what's happenin'. (pauses) You know, we had a big storm last week... (trails off) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my mouth.

I've been tryin' to eat more, but it's just not stayin' on me. And these antacids... they're okay, I guess. Not great, but they help a little bit. My husband says I'm gettin' too old for this sorta thing... (chuckles) Too old? Me? Ha! I'm fine! (pauses again) You know, we used to have these big ol' dinners at our house... my mom would make the most wonderful roast beef... (trails off once more)

Oh dear, where's my list? Ah yes...

Burning in my upper abdomen... so it happens throughout the day or at night, not just during meals, which is puzzling. (pauses again) Now what was I saying? Ah yes, burning sensation. And then there are these extreme nauseous episodes, like I'm going to keel over any minute now. Heartburn and indigestion too... you know, just last week, I had the most delicious prime rib at the community center dinner...

Now, let me think on this for a minute... heartburn, indigestion... that's what the young'un said last time I was in here. (chuckles) You know, my granddaughter's always tellin' me to watch what I eat... can't recall what she said exactly, but it had somethin' to do with fried foods and coffee... or was it tea? (laughs) Oh dear, I get confused sometimes...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the burnin' sensation... sometimes it's a dull ache, other times it's this sharp pain... hard to describe. (pauses again) Did I tell you about my garden? The tomatoes are comin' in fine this year... almost as big as... well, never mind. So, like I was sayin', these symptoms... they come on without warnin', if you know what I mean.

Now, now let me think on that for a sec... (pauses once more) Oh dearie me! I remember when my husband had this one... this one problem... wasn't it his stomach too? (pauses again) Wait, no, that's not right. We were talkin' about the time he went to... (trails off)

Oh, never mind! It don't matter. The point is... this burnin' sensation and all these other symptoms... I just hope you can figure out what it is... and give me some of them tablets or somethin' to make it stop."
231,peptic ulcer disease,"I have both bloating and unease. I no longer like eating because I've been losing weight. I sometimes vomit blood and have tarry, black stools.","Oh dear... I'm so tired of feelin' bloated all the time. You know, like a big ol' balloon in my stomach. And then there's this unease, it's hard to explain. It's like my gut's talkin' to me, sayin', ""Get outta here!"" (laughs) I don't even want to eat no more, but I need somethin'. Problem is, I've been losin' weight and... uh... how long has it been? Three weeks? Four? Lord have mercy, my memory's gettin' worse than my cookin'! Anyway, I haven't liked food for a while now. Sometimes after eatin', I feel this... this... (pauses) Oh, what's the word? Ah yes, nausea. Nausea's got me all day long. And sometimes, oh dear... sometimes I vomit up blood. Dark red, like tarry stuff. Black stools too. (trails off) My sister's been sayin' she's worried about my eatin', but I just tell her it's the food, not me... (sighs)","I don't know if I'm makin' a big deal outta this, but... bloating, yeah, that's been goin' on for weeks now. Felt like a balloon in my stomach, you know? And unease, oh boy, it's like I've got knots in here somewhere. Don't like eatin' no more 'cause, well... (pauses) wait, when was the last time I ate, dearie me? Oh yeah, breakfast this mornin'. Toast and eggs... or was that lunch yesterday? Anyway...

Lost a bit of weight, can't deny it. Clothes feel looser than they used to. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. What do you think about these new pants I got from Walmart? They were on sale... (chuckles) You know, back in my day we didn't buy pants with elastic waistbands...

Now this is the thing: sometimes, after eatin', I get a little queasy and then... oh dear lord... it's like my stomach decides to give up. Vomit, they call it? Yeah, that's what I do. And once in a while, I'll be lookin' at the toilet paper roll thinkin', ""What's that weird brown stuff?"" That'd be tarry stools. Blood and whatnot. Not pretty, if you know what I mean.

And this isn't just one or two times; it happens more often than not. Maybe I should get some Beano or somethin'? (pauses) What was the name of that other thing... umph! Oh right, Metamucil! Take that every day and my digestive system'll be in tip-top shape... (trails off)"
232,peptic ulcer disease,I frequently get swallowing issues and the sensation that food is getting stuck in my throat. I regularly belch and feel bloated. My aftertaste is unpleasant all the time.,"Oh dearie me... I've been having these troubles with swallowing, you see. It's quite uncomfortable, really. Food gets stuck in my throat, if you know what I mean. And then there's the belching... (pauses) You know, it's funny, I had the most dreadful time at the dinner party last week. The soup was too hot, and I ended up spilling it all over my new blouse. (chuckles) Ah yes, anyway...

As I was saying, these swallowing issues have been going on for... well, let me see... is it three weeks now? Four? (hesitates) Oh dear, the names are getting jumbled in my head... Ah yes! Food stuck in my throat. And then there's this bloating feeling afterwards. Unpleasant, really. Can't quite put my finger on what causes it... Do you think it might be something I ate? Or maybe it's just old age catching up with me... (sighs) Oh dearie me...","Now let me tell you... I don't know if this is related but my sister had something similar when she was younger. No, wait, that was her mother. Anyway...

So these swallowing problems I've been having... (pauses) Oh dear, I think it started after I ate that big ol' turkey sandwich last Thanksgiving. Wasn't it the year before? Hmm, no matter. It's just... well, you see, sometimes food gets stuck in my throat and I have to swallow it like twice or more just to get it down. And then I burp a lot. (chuckles) Sorry about that.

And this bloating business... (hesitates) Could be gas, could be water retention. I used to drink beer with the boys, but that was years ago. Don't think that's got anything to do with it now. Although I did try that new probiotic yogurt... (trails off)

Now, where were we? Ah yes... unpleasant aftertaste. That's been going on for as long as I can remember. Always tasted like something sour or metallic in my mouth. Reminds me of the time I got food poisoning at the diner back in '62. No, that's not it either...

Oh dear, what was I saying? Oh yes! Swallowing problems and... (laughs) You know, I think I might have gotten some of this from eating too many beans. Beans, you see... Not just any beans, but those big ol' green ones my wife used to make with the rice and chicken..."
233,peptic ulcer disease,"My bloody stools have caused me to lose a lot of things, including iron and bloos. I now have anaemia as a result, and I typically feel rather weak.","I'm afraid I've been having some trouble with my, ah, digestive system lately. You see, I've been experiencing bloody stools...

It's caused me to lose a lot of blood, and now I'm worried I might have anemia. Doctor Smith said something like that last week, or was it two weeks ago? (pauses again) Never mind...

And I've been taking iron supplements, but they don't seem to be helping much.","(Background noise of TV in the distance, gentle hum of a fan)

Well, you see... I've been having these... (pauses) bloody stools, yes, that's it! Bloody stools. Not just once or twice, no sir... every day for weeks now. And with those bloody stools... comes a lot of iron loss, if I'm not mistaken. My sister-in-law's cousin had something like that too, but she got some newfangled pills and it fixed her right up. Anyway...

Now, I've been feeling rather weak lately. Can't even walk the dog without needing to sit down for a spell. And my hair's all thinning out on top... (chuckles) just like Grandpa used to say would happen if you didn't eat your vitamins! Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, anaemia... I think that's what they called it. You know, I read something about that in a magazine once... or was it the newspaper?

Wait, I remember now! My friend Mabel had something similar to this, but she went to one of those new-agey doctors and got some fancy treatment. (pauses) Or was it her sister? Hmmph. Anyways...

I'm sure it's just what you young folks would call... (snaps fingers) a common condition! Yes, yes! Not that I've been diagnosed or anything, but I do have this feeling of... (struggles to find words) lightheadedness when I stand up too fast. Like my knees'll give out on me! You know how it is when you get older...

What was the name of that new medication...? Oh dearie me, now it's gone and hopped outta my head! (laughs softly)"

Now, where did I put that recipe for my wife's goulash? Ah yes! Anyway... stomach hurts and cramps like I'm gettin' a stomach bug or somethin'. And after I eat, it gets even worse. Gas and bloating, oh dear Lord! It's like someone poured air into me. (pauses) You know what reminded me of this? My cousin Edna's son-in-law had a similar problem last year... something about the stomach... uh, what was it called again? Anyway, like I said, it hurts and cramps after meals. And gas! It's just awful!""","Oh dear... my appetite, you see... (pauses) Ah yes, it's just like when I was younger... (trails off) My mother used to make these wonderful beef stews... You know what I mean?

Yes, so my appetite is fierce. Like a lion! (laughs) And the hunger, well... it's just this constant growling in my belly. I swear, it's like someone's trying to tell me something. (pauses) Oh, did I tell you about that time we went to the beach? No, never mind... not now...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, stomach hurts and cramps. Sometimes it feels like a knife twisting inside me. And don't even get me started on the gas! (laughs awkwardly) Very painful, you know? Like someone's punching me in the gut. (pauses again)

After a meal... (stammers) You see, I had this big plate of spaghetti last week... Oh, my sister made it for us. Such a lovely cook! Anyway... after a meal, like I was saying... the gas and bloating. It's just awful. (sighs) And then I start to feel all... (pauses once more) cloudy-headed. Like I've been eating too much cheese or something.

Now what was that recipe my mother used to make? The one with the carrots and potatoes...? Ah dear, it'll come to me eventually... (trails off)

I'm getting on in years, you know? My body's just not what it used to be. (chuckles wistfully) Ah well...

I've been feeling pretty weak, lack of energy, always tired, ya know? And my appetite's not what it used to be either. Used to love a good breakfast, but now even toast sounds like too much effort.

Now, let me think... when was it that I last went to the bathroom like a normal person? Hmm... must've been... (pauses, looks around the room) ...last week? No, no, not last week. The week before that! Yes, I'm sure of it. (laughs)

Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. So, I wake up in the morning, and instead of being all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed like I used to be, I'm just... (sighs) ...tired. Lack of energy, that's what I call it. Don't know if you've ever experienced it, doctor? No, no, course not! You're always full of energy and vigor! (laughs)

And my appetite? Fuhgeddaboutit! (chuckles) Can barely keep anything down. Tastes like cardboard to me now. Remember that time I went on vacation with my husband? We had the most wonderful trip to Florida... (pauses, looks around the room) ...or was it Arizona? Oh dearie, I'm getting all mixed up!

Oh, and one more thing! My granddaughter was telling me about some newfangled way of eating that's supposed to help with digestion. She said something about probiotics or was it prebiotics? (shrugs) Don't know the difference, but she seemed quite convinced... (trails off)

Certain meals... like that one time I had that spicy Korean dish at my grandson's birthday party... or was it my granddaughter? Anyway, it didn't agree with me, if you know what I mean.

(pauses) Just like that one time, I was picking up groceries and my back went out on me... no, wait, that wasn't it... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, stomach troubles.

Now, when I eat certain foods, you know, those spicy things or the tomato sauce ones... they make me feel all puffed up, if you catch my drift. (chuckles) And sometimes, oh dear me, it's like a big storm inside me, if you will. I'll get loose stools, that's what I call 'em, and, well, let's just say it's not the most pleasant feeling in the world.

But, between you and me, doctor... or should I say, is this a good time? (looks around) Oh, anyway, as I was saying, my stomach troubles only come when I'm doing something specific. It doesn't matter if I'm eating a nice roast chicken or some fresh fruit; it's just those other foods that get me all... (taps fingers on armrest) you know what I mean?

Ah yes, here they are! Now, let me think this through again...

But, as I was saying, my bloody stools... it's just not right. Losing so much blood and iron, and now this anaemia thingy... what was the doctor's name again? Oh dear, got a bit mixed up... (sighs) Ah well, maybe you can help me out, young one..."
244,peptic ulcer disease,I have a strong appetite and am constantly hungry. My stomach occasionally aches and cramps. I have really painful gas and bloating after eating.,"""I'm always hungry, you know? Can't seem to fill my belly no matter what I eat. My stomach... (pauses) Oh, did I tell you about my grandkids' visit last week? Anyway... sometimes it gets a little sore after eating. Not too often, mind you, but enough to be a nuisance. And then there's the gas... good grief, it's like a war in there! (chuckles) I swear, it's worse than when I ate those beans from the can last Tuesday. Or was that Wednesday? Anyway... (pauses again) Ah yes, the gas and bloating after meals. Like yesterday morning, for instance... no, wait, was it Thursday? Never mind. It's all so... (sighs) You get my point, though.""","I've been gettin' these hunger pangs somethin' fierce. Can't seem to fill my belly no matter what I eat. And then there's this...this achin' in my stomach, cramps and all that. It don't feel right, ya know? (pauses) Now where did I put my reading glasses?

Oh, yes! The hunger pangs. I've been eatin' more than usual, but I'm still hungry as a bear wakin' up from hibernation. My wife says I must be gettin' older or somethin'. (chuckles) She's always sayin' that.

Painful gas and bloatin', too...that's the worst part. It feels like my insides are tryin' to escape, ya know? Like a big ol' pressure cooker about to blow its top. And it's after every meal, too. Don't matter if I'm eatin' somethin' light or somethin' heavy, that bloatin' and discomfort just won't quit.

You know, reminds me of when...when was it? Ah yes! When my neighbor's cat got stuck in the tree! (laughs) Poor thing was up there for hours before we managed to coax 'em down. But I digress...

Now, this stomach business...like I said, it comes and goes. Some days it's nothin', next day it's like a knife stabbin' me right through the gut. Must be my age, or maybe it's the cheeseburgers... (mumbles to self) Was it Tuesday when we went shopping?"
245,peptic ulcer disease,I've been experiencing bowel movements that are both constipated and diarrhoeic. I often lack the will to eat and energy.,"You know, doc... (pauses) I've been having some trouble with my bowel movements lately. They're constipated one day and then diarrheic the next. Can't seem to make up their mind, if you know what I mean. (chuckles)

I was just talking to my neighbor's son, Jimmy – or is it John? Ah, no matter... He's got a nice lawn, by the way. Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, my bowels. They're all over the place. Sometimes I can go days without using the bathroom, and then suddenly... (makes a rushing sound with mouth) ...it's like a floodgate opened.

I just don't feel like eating, doc. No energy at all. Must be that new medication I'm on... or is it the old one? (laughs) Oh dear, I get those two mixed up sometimes.

You know, I was reading about some of these new-fangled supplements for digestion. Don't know if they'd do any good, but I might give 'em a try.","I don't know if this is what I have, Doctor... (pauses) My stomach's been acting up something fierce lately. You see, one day I'm regular as clockwork, and the next I'm runnin' to the bathroom every five minutes. Can't hold it in no more. Then again, some days it's like tryin' to move a boulder – (chuckles) my goodness gracious... it's just not movin', if you know what I mean.

And don't even get me started on eatin'. I swear, I used to have the appetite of a horse, but now I'm lucky if I can finish a bowl of oatmeal. Just feel like... (pauses) where was I goin' with that thought? Oh yes! I just feel so tired all the time. Tired and... and (struggles to find words) bloated, maybe?

Now, what was it you asked me about again? Ah yes, my symptoms! (chuckles) Goodness gracious, I'm gettin' old, ain't I? (laughs) You know, back in the war, we had some of the best cooks in the army. They'd whip up these... these... uh... what was it called, Edna's Special? No, no, that wasn't it... anyway, it was this wonderful soup that'd stick to your ribs like glue.

But I digress! (pauses) So, about these bowel movements... sometimes they're loose as a goose, and other times it's like tryin' to push through molasses. Can't seem to figure out what's causin' it. Maybe I ate somethin' bad? Or maybe it's just my old colon actin' up again? (chuckles) Well, that's just the life of an old soldier, ain't it?

(Trails off into incoherent mumbling) What was I sayin'? Oh yes, the energy! Goodness gracious, I used to be able to mow the lawn without breakin' a sweat... now I'm gaspin' for air after just walkin' across the room... (sighs) Ah well..."
246,peptic ulcer disease,"Only when I hunch down or lie down does my stomach hurt more. I have pain after eating certain foods, such as hot or acidic food. I occasionally get loose stools as a result of this.","You know, doc... (pauses) Oh, I was thinking about that recipe my sister-in-law gave me for her famous lasagna. Always makes a big impression at family gatherings... anyway... (clears throat)

When I hunch down or lie down, you see... it's like my stomach is telling me something. (chuckles) I swear, it's like it's trying to get my attention. And then the pain starts. More so than when I'm standing up straight, that's for sure.

Now, about these certain foods... hot and acidic ones are troublemakers. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time I ate that spicy sauce at Joe's restaurant? Oh boy... my stomach was rumbling like a drum set afterwards! (laughs)

Yes, well... eating those types of food makes me feel terrible. And sometimes, afterward... (hesitates) what was it called? Loose stools, yes! That's it! They come as a surprise, like a little unwelcome visitor in the middle of the night.","I don't know if I'm getting better or worse, doc... or is it doctor? Anyway, you know what I mean. This stomach business of mine... (pauses) Did I turn off the stove? I could've sworn I turned it off... No, no, that's not important now.

Oh yes! So my stomach hurts more when I hunch down like this, you see. Or lie down. That's when it gets all achy and whatnot. It's like a dull knife or something. (chuckles) Not that I'm complaining, mind you... Just can't seem to figure out what's causing it.

Now let me think... Food. Ah yes! Certain foods make my stomach hurt more. You see, hot food, it's just too much for my poor insides. And acidic... Lord have mercy, don't get me started on those tomatoes. (pauses) Tomatoes, were we talking about tomatoes? No, no, what was the point again?

Loose stools, that's another thing. I get those from eating, well, you know what I mean. These certain foods just upset my stomach and... (stammers) Oh dear me, I'm getting all mixed up! What were we discussing again? Ah yes, food.

Now where did I put that recipe book? My wife used to make the best tomato soup, but I think it was the tomatoes that did me in. (laughs) Not that I'm saying my wife's cooking is bad... (trails off)

Anyway, when I eat those spicy or sour foods, my stomach starts aching something fierce. Like I said, it hurts more when I sit down or lie down. But, you know what? Sometimes it feels like someone's poking me in the ribs with a stick... or was that a dream? (chuckles) Oh dear!"
247,peptic ulcer disease,I can't get to sleep or remain asleep because I have a stomach pain. I get exhausted after using the bathroom and stop being hungry. I worry a lot of the time.,"Doc, you know what's been botherin' me? I just can't get no sleep at night. No sir, my stomach's been achin' somethin' fierce. I mean, it started about... well, now let me think... was it last week? Yeah, last Tuesday, I'm pretty sure. Or was it Wednesday? Anyway, my belly's been hurtin', and I wake up in the middle of the night, feelin' like I gotta run to the bathroom again. And then I get so tired from gettin' up, you know? It's just like that time I went to the grocery store... uh, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah! My stomach pain. It keeps me up all night, and when I finally do fall asleep, I'm exhausted. Can't even think about eatin', either... or so it seems. Worryin' a lot these days, too...","I don't know how much longer I can... (pauses) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, sleep. Can't seem to get a wink no matter what I do. Stomach's been acting up somethin' fierce. Got this... this burning sensation, you see. And it hurts so much in the night, I just lie there thinkin', ""What's goin' on?"" (pauses again)

And then there's the bathroom trips. Oh my stars, I swear I'm gettin' up at least three times a night now. It's like my body's decided to play tricks on me. After each trip, I just... (yawns) excuse me... feel so exhausted all of a sudden. Don't know what's wrong with me.

Food, you know? Used to love eatin', but lately... (shrugs) not hungry no more. Guess that's somethin' too. (pauses once more)

Worry, worry... (sighs) Can't seem to shake it off. I keep thinkin' about... uh, what was the doctor say? No, wait, it was... (pauses again) Oh dear, my husband used to say that when he was workin', and they'd get these stress headaches... Ah, but that's not important right now.

Now where was I? Ah yes, stomach pain. Like a band around my middle all the time. Makes me uncomfortable, if you know what I mean. (pauses again)"
248,peptic ulcer disease,"My mouth is filled with a sour, acidic flavour. I have frequent belching and burping. My upper abdomen has felt pressed in or full for the past few hours.","""Ah, doc... my mouth, you see... tastes like... uh... vinegar? Yeah, that's the word. Sour and acidic, like when I was a kid and my grandmother used to make me eat those pickles from her garden. (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm getting ahead of myself...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, belching. I do get these... these big ones, you know? And they're not just little puffs, no sir. These are like... (pauses to think) ...mini-tornadoes in my chest! (laughs)

Now, about this pressing feeling in my upper abdomen... I'm pretty sure it started last night, or was it yesterday evening? I got so mixed up with the bingo game at the senior center... (trails off) Wait, what was I saying?

Oh yes, the squeezing. It's like someone's got their thumb on me, right here (taps upper abdomen). But don't you worry, doc, I'm not in pain or nothing. Just a bit... uneasy, that's all.""","You know, doc... (pauses) I'm not sure if this is related, but my grandkids were over yesterday, playing with them new-fangled tablets... (chuckles) Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my mouth. It's all sour, acidic-like. You know what I mean by that? Like when you drink a glass of lemonade and it's all puckering your lips? That's what it feels like in here (taps chest). And then, there's the belching... Lord have mercy, I've been burping more than my husband has lately! (laughs)

Now, let me think on this... What was the other thing? Oh yes, my stomach. It's been feeling... (pauses) full, pressed in. You know how it feels when you eat too much of that rich Christmas pudding? That's what it's like now. But I haven't eaten anything out of the ordinary. Unless... unless you count that piece of pie at church yesterday? No, no, that was days ago... (trails off)

Anyway, like I said, my mouth and stomach. And this bloated feeling. It's been going on for a few hours now. I was hoping it would pass after dinner, but no such luck. I'm starting to worry about my digestion, if you know what I mean... (trails off again) Did I tell you about the time I went to Europe? Fascinating experience... (continues speaking in a wandering manner)"
249,peptic ulcer disease,"I unintentionally lose weight and find it challenging to gain it back. To relieve the pain and discomfort I feel, I take antacids. My mouth hurts so severely right now.","You know, Doc... or is it Nurse? Oh dear, I always get that mixed up. Anyway, my weight just keeps slipping away from me. Unintentional, you see. I used to weigh more, much more. Now I'm down to... um... what was the number again? Ah yes, 120 pounds. And no matter how many calories I consume, I just can't seem to put on any weight. It's like my body has a mind of its own. You know, reminds me of when I used to visit my sister in Chicago... (pauses) Oh, right! My stomach's been acting up something fierce too. I take those little antacid tablets, you know, the ones that turn your tongue blue? Tums or whatever it is... anyway, they help with the pain a bit. But today, oh boy, my mouth hurts like the devil himself is gnawing at me. It's aching so bad... (winces in pain)","I don't know if I told you this before... (pauses) Weight loss... yeah, that's what it is. Unintentional weight loss. Been happenin' for years now. Can't seem to gain it back no matter how much I eat. Doctor said something about me needin' more protein or somethin', but I don't know... (chuckles) Used to be a big eater, always had an appetite.

Now, this mouth of mine... hurts somethin' fierce. Take antacids all the time for it. Don't know what else to do. (pauses again) You know, my sister used to have stomach problems too... always complainin' about her belly. I think she said it was from eatin' that spicy food... no, wait, was it gas? Or was it her appendix? (laughs) Oh dear, I get all confused sometimes...

Anyway, back to this weight loss. It's been goin' on for so long now. Don't know what's causin' it. Used to be a healthy eater, always cooked from scratch... but now I just don't have an appetite no more. And when I do eat somethin', it comes right back out again. (sighs) Frustratin'.

You know, I remember when I was younger... we used to go on these long walks every day after dinner. Walkin' the dog, that is. Yes, my husband's old golden retriever. He'd chase sticks and whatnot. Good times... good times. (trails off) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, weight loss. (pauses again)

I don't know if you can do anythin' about this, but it's just been ploddin' along like this for so long now. Losin' weight and feelin' miserable... no wonder I'm havin' trouble eatin'. Don't know what else to say... (trails off)"
250,diabetes,I have increased thirst and frequent urination. I often have a dry mouth and throat. Recently I have been having increased hunger and appetite,"You know, Doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' so thirsty lately. Water's all I can think about. Increased thirst, that's what it is. Can't drink enough. And then there's this frequent urination... (chuckles) Lord have mercy, my bladder's workin' overtime! Dry mouth and throat too. My poor gums are sufferin'. Now, I'm not sure if it's because of the holiday dinner or not... we had that big turkey on Thanksgiving... but I swear, Doc, I've been feelin' this dryness for months now. And then, just yesterday - or was it last week? (laughs) Oh dear, my mind's goin'! Anyway... increased hunger and appetite too. I'm always reachin' for snacks. What do you think, Doctor?","(Background noise of TV static, distant kitchen sounds) Oh dear... Doc, I'm having all these... (pauses) problems with my... (hesitates) you know what. Water. And eating. (chuckles) Well, not water exactly, but drinking it. Yes, that's the word. Drinking. I have this... (pauses again) dryness in my mouth and throat. It's like sandpaper, all gritty-like. My tongue feels... (struggles to find the right word) stiff, yes, stiff.

And then there's... (stammers) hunger! Oh boy, I'm eating like a horse now! More than usual, that is. My wife says I've gained some weight lately. (chuckles) Don't tell her I said this, but she might be right. (laughs nervously)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, thirst. It's like my body's... (tries to remember the word) parched! No, that's not it. Dried out, maybe? Anyway, I'm drinking more water than I ever have before, and still... (pauses once more) still nothing seems to quench this... this craving.

Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, the dry mouth and throat. It's been going on for a while now. Weeks, months... (confused) time flies when you're having fun, right? (laughs again) I'm not sure how long it's been happening. But it's getting worse, that's what worries me.

(TV static in the background continues to play)

( Patient trails off, lost in thought)"
251,diabetes,I have blurred vision and it only seems to be getting worse. I feel fatigued and tired all the time. I also feel very dizzy and light headed at times,"I'm tellin' ya, Doc... I got this blurred vision and it just gets worse every day. Can't see the TV no more, can't even read my newspaper... (pauses) Oh, I remember when I used to read that big ol' paper, The Chronicle... (chuckles) My sister Edna used to give me a hard time about it... anyway...

Fatigue, that's what the nurse at the clinic said. Yeah, I'm tired all the time. Can't even make it through my gardenin' without takin' a nap on the bench. And dizzy spells? Shoot, just the other day I was fixin' to go out for lunch with Helen... or was it Mary? Ah, shoot, their names get all mixed up now days...

Dizzy and light headed, that's what it feels like. Can't even hold my cup of coffee steady no more... (pauses) You know, I think I saw a doctor about this on Wednesday... or was it Thursday?","I don't know if I should be telling you this, but... (pauses) My doctor's appointment was just yesterday, wasn't it? No, wait, that was last week... Anyway, my eyesight, it's been acting up something fierce. Can't focus on nothing no more. Blurry, yeah, that's the word. Like I'm looking at everything through a dirty windowpane or somethin'. Got me worried sick.

And then there's this tiredness. Lord have mercy, I'm as tired as a hound dog in July. Don't know what's wrong with me no more. Used to be able to do the gardening without breakin' a sweat... now I'm gaspin' for air just walkin' from the car to the house. (pauses) You know, my grandmother used to have that same problem. I think it was something to do with her blood pressure...

Now this dizziness and lightheadedness... feels like I'm sailin' on a ship in a storm or somethin'. Get up from the couch and suddenly I'm seein' stars all over the room. (chuckles) Course, that's what happens when you get old, right? Everything starts to get a little fuzzy around the edges...

(suddenly becomes distracted) Did I tell you about my trip to the lake last summer? Beautiful weather... my grandkids were with me, and we had us a time to remember... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, dizzy spells. Like I said, they're gettin' worse. Sometimes it takes me a good minute to steady myself after standin' up. Can't say I'm exactly sure what's causin' all this, but I reckon I'll trust your expertise on that one..."
252,diabetes,I have a dry mouth and throat. I also have been experiencing an increased appetite and hunger. However I do feel very tired at times,"""Oh dear, my mouth and throat are as dry as the Sahara desert. I've been drinkin' water like a fish, but nothin's seemin' to help. And would you believe it, I've got an appetite for days! I mean, I'm always hungry, not just at mealtimes. It's like my stomach's growin' its own engine or somethin'. But between you and me, doc... I was thinkin', what day is today? Ah yes, Wednesday. Or is it Thursday? Oh well, doesn't matter now. My daughter said I'm gettin' a new teeth-whitening kit for my birthday. (pauses) Anyway, the fatigue's been gettin' to me somethin' fierce... sometimes I just wanna curl up on the couch and take a nap for hours. Must be this heatwave...""","Oh dear doctor... my mouth's all dry, you know? Like the Sahara desert in here (taps chest). Can't seem to swallow nothin' properly neither. Throat's all scratchy and whatnot. Now, I know it sounds silly, but I'm starin' at this sandwich I had for lunch... (pauses) Hmm, was it today or yesterday? Wait, where was I goin'? Ah yes, my throat.

You see, doc... I've been feelin' rather peckish lately. No, no, not just peckish, famished! My stomach's been growlin' like a bear. (chuckles) Don't know what it is, but I could eat a whole horse by myself. Just thinking about food makes me tired... (sighs)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my energy levels. Well, I've been feelin' rather... (pauses, searching for the right word) lethargic? That's it! Lethargic. Can't seem to get nothin' done without a nice long nap in the middle of the day. Don't know what's goin' on, doc... (trails off)

You know, I had this cousin, Edna... she was a real firecracker, that one. (laughs) Always sayin' ""get up and get movin'!"" But then again, I think she had some trouble with her thyroid or somethin'. Now, what was the question? Oh dear..."
253,diabetes,I have slow healing of wounds and cuts. I have this tingling sensation in my hand and numbness in both my hands and feet,"You know, I had this scrape on my elbow last week... or was it two weeks ago? No, no, that wasn't it... anyway, it took forever to heal. And now I've got another one on my knee, and it's still not closed up yet. Slow healing, you see. My grandson's cousin has a similar problem, but he's younger than me, of course. Oh dear, what was the name of that medicine they gave him? Ah yes, something with a ""C"" in it... (chuckles) Anyway...

And then there's this tingling sensation in my hand... feels like pins and needles all the time. I try to shake it off, but it doesn't go away. And both hands, you see, not just one. Same with my feet, numbness all over. It's rather annoying, if you know what I mean.","I think I've been tellin' you this for years now... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my wounds, they just won't heal right. Can't even cut myself without gettin' a scab that stays on forever! (chuckles) Like that one time, no, it wasn't like that at all... anyway... and these tinglin' sensations in my hand... it's like pins and needles but not quite... (pauses again) You know what I mean? No, you probably don't, but never mind...

It started with just my hands, both of 'em, actually. And now my feet are gettin' all numb too! (gets sidetracked) My wife used to say that was from standin' on the icebox when we were young... (laughs) Oh Lord, I'm not even sure where the icebox is anymore... or if it's still in our house...

Anyway, back to this numbin' and tinglin'... sometimes it goes away for a bit, but then it comes back. And with these wounds! It's like they just won't close up no matter what I do. I've been tryin' every ointment under the sun... (mutters to self) Did I tell you about that time I tried that new salve?... No, no, don't mind me...

I think it might be connected to my varicose veins? Or maybe it's just old age catchin' up with me. (giggles) I swear, I can remember when my feet didn't ache like this! Anyway, as I was sayin', these symptoms... they're gettin' on my nerves somethin' fierce!"
254,diabetes,I have mood changes and have difficulty concentrating. My mind feels hazy and foggy at times and it gets difficult to do even regular chores,"Doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' real funny lately. Mood swings, ya know? One minute I'm fine, the next I'm just... (chuckles) oh, you know what I was thinkin' about? My cousin Edna's cat, Mr. Whiskers. He used to get stuck in my garden all the time. (laughs) Anyway... like I said, mood swings and concentration. It's hard for me to sit still and focus. I'll be watchin' TV or somethin', and suddenly my mind just goes blank. Foggy, that's the best way to describe it. Like tryin' to get out of a thick fog. Can't quite remember what day it is today... (pauses) Oh dear, I think it's Tuesday?... (trails off)

(Background noise: muffled TV chatter in the distance, occasional clinking dishes or glasses being washed)","I'm gettin' a bit... you know, funny in the head, doc. Can't seem to focus like I used to. (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I went fishin' on Lake Erie? Beautiful day, caught me a big ol' bass... (trails off)

Oh yes, my mind's all hazy and foggy at times. I was just tryin' to pay the bills yesterday, and I couldn't even remember where I put the checkbook. (chuckles) Guess that's what happens when you get old, eh? Can't keep track of nothin'. (pauses)

I've been feelin' a little... irritable, I suppose you'd say. Mood swings like my sister used to have before she passed away. (gets distracted) Did I tell you about the time we went on that family vacation to Florida? My cousin Jimmy had a pet monkey... (stops suddenly)

Regular chores, doc? Forget about it! Can't even remember where I put the groceries most days. (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now. What was the question again? (pauses, looking around the room)

Anyway, like I said, my mind's in a fog. Trouble focusin', trouble rememberin'. (stares off into space) Now where did I put that other shoe?... Ah yes! Chores. Can't even do simple tasks without gettin' all mixed up. Guess it's just part of gettin' older... or is it the medication? (frowns, trying to recall)

(mumbles to self) Lake Erie, bass fishin', Florida vacation..."
255,diabetes,I have a feeling of tremors and muscle twitching. I have decreased sense of smell or taste and I feel fatigued. Sometimes I have a feeling of rapid hearbeat or palipatations,"""Doctor... I've been feelin' like my whole body's shakin', ya know? Like them tremors, they're gettin' worse. And my muscles, they're twitchin' somethin' fierce. Can't even watch TV without seein' it. Reminds me of that time my grandson's hamster got loose... (chuckles) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the tremors. And then there's this other thing, can't smell nothin', and taste's gone too. It's like bein' a ghost, if you know what I mean. (pauses) Fatigued, that's the word... I get tired just walkin' to the mailbox. And my heart, it's racin' somethin' awful. Palipations, that's what they call it, right? Always feel like I'm runnin' a marathon.""","I don't know if I'm gettin' a little too old for this... (chuckles) Ah yes, my tremors. They come and go, like the weather. Sometimes they're as bad as thunderstorms, and other times it's just a light sprinkle. You see, I was at the market yesterday, and I saw this young fella with a box of chocolates. Reminded me of your visit last week... (pauses) Where was I? Ah yes, my tremors.

They feel like these little pinches all over my body. Can't even hold my cup steady no more. My wife says it's just age, but I know what I'm feelin'. Now, let me think on this... What was the word I wanted to use? (taps foot) Ah yes, fatigue! That's right. I get so tired all of a sudden, like someone pulled the plug out from under me.

And my senses, dear Lord... (shakes head) My smell's gone haywire. Can't even smell that nice roast chicken at home no more. Taste's gone too, almost as if my tongue's shrunk down to a raisin. Don't know what's causin' all this, but I'm hopin' you can figure it out.

Sometimes... (pauses) Sometimes I get these palpitations. They feel like someone's put their hand on my heart and is wavin' it around like a rag doll. Scared the life outta me last week! Thought I was havin' a heart attack or somethin'. But then again, I did have one of those... (pauses) What's called it... ""Oh, you know what I mean!"" Ah yes! Heartburn. Must've just been that."
256,diabetes,I have rashes and skin irritations especially in the folds of the skin. There is also very slow healing of any cuts and bruises I have on my skin,"""Doctor... I don't know if I told you about this already, but I've been having these rashes and skin irritations... yeah, especially in the folds of my skin, like under my arms and between my legs. Can't remember exactly when it started, but it's been a few months now, maybe more? Anyway, it's really itchy and sometimes blisters up too.

And then there's these cuts I got on my hand... (pauses) Oh, you know, we went to the garden center last week, and I was trying to water that new plant of mine... (chuckles) Anyway, those cuts have been slow to heal, really slow. Like, they're still open after two weeks now... two weeks? Could it be three? Hmm... Oh, and my bruises too, like that one on my knee... (pauses again) Never mind, what was I saying? Ah yes, the rashes...""","I'm so sorry to bother you with this... *pauses* My skin's been acting up something awful. You see, I was at the early bird special at Denny's the other day and I had the most wonderful eggs benedict... *trails off* Wait, what was I saying? Oh yes, my skin. It's got all these rashes and irritations, especially where it folds in on itself, you know, like between the toes or under the chin. My granddaughter says it looks like I've been out in the sun too long, but I don't think that's it... *pauses again* 

Now, let me see if I can remember the other thing... Ah yes! The cuts and bruises, they just won't heal. It takes forever for them to scab over. My brother had a similar problem, or was it my cousin? No, no, it was definitely my brother. He got some cream from the doctor that helped, but I think he went out of town... *chuckles* Oh dear, I'm getting all confused now.

Anyway, these rashes and skin irritations, they're quite painful, especially at night when I'm trying to sleep. And like I said, my cuts and bruises just won't heal. It's very frustrating, let me tell you... *pauses once more* Do you think it might have something to do with the new laundry detergent I started using? I've heard some of those chemicals can cause all sorts of problems..."
257,diabetes,I have a frequent need to urinate and often have these uncontrollable urges. I feel dizzy and often confused. I have also been loss of visuals,"I don't know how long this has been goin' on... I've just been gettin' up in the middle of the night so much lately... my bladder, you know... (pauses) You'd think I'm drinkin' too much water or somethin', but nope. It's like it's... callin' me to the bathroom every hour on the hour! Uncontrollable, that's the word. I swear, I'll be right in the middle of watchin' my soap operas and suddenly I gotta go, now.

And then there's this dizziness. I feel... light-headed. Don't know what to call it. (pauses) Like when I used to take those new-fangled pills for high blood pressure, but no, no, that's not it at all. Oh dear me, I had the most peculiar episode last week... where was I? Ah yes! My dizziness. It's got me a little mixed up sometimes, if you know what I mean.

Loss of visuals, is that what it's called? (pauses) You see, I'm pretty sure my eyes are fine... but then again, maybe they're not. (chuckles) Oh dearie, I had the most wonderful time at the park last week with Edna and her grandkids... anyway... these vision things... blurry or somethin'...","I'm sorry, dear... can't quite get a hold on what I was sayin'. Ah, yes! The bathroom. It seems like every five minutes or so, I gotta go, ya know? Can't explain it, just feels like my bladder's got its own mind now. And them urges... (pauses) where did I put my reading glasses? Ah, bother...

Anyway, where was I? Oh yes! Dizzy spells. Get 'em all the time. Feel like I'm walkin' on clouds or somethin'. Can't even keep track of what day it is. My wife always says I get confused sometimes... (chuckles) now that's a good joke, by the way...

What was the other thing? Ah yes! Loss of visuals. That's right. Felt like I was lookin' at a blurry picture or somethin'. Can't quite describe it. Like tryin' to remember where I put my keys... (laughs) now that's a mystery for the ages!

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The doctor said somethin' about me gettin' old. Well, you're darn right I'm gettin' old! Been feelin' like this for weeks now. Can't even remember where my car keys are... (pauses) what was the question again?"
258,diabetes,I have difficulty breathing especially during physical activity. I have unusual sweating and flushing. I frequently get yeast infections,"Oh dear doctor... (pauses) You know, I was just watching the game on TV yesterday and they said something about heart problems, but that can't be right, my cousin Edna had a heart problem and she's still going strong at 92... (chuckles) Anyway...

I have this trouble breathing, especially when I'm out walking or doin' chores. It's like my chest is gettin' all tight and I gotta catch my breath quick. And then there's the sweatin', it's always on me, even when it's chilly outside. I'll be makin' a cup of tea, and suddenly I'm drenched... (pauses) What was I talkin' about again?

Oh yes, and them yeast infections. They're just awful! My daughter says they're common for women our age, but it feels like I get 'em all the time now. Must be connected to this breathin' business, don't you think? (trails off) Wait, where's my reading glasses?","I don't know if this is related but my nephew's dog was panting like that last summer... anyway, I have some trouble catchin' my breath when I'm doin' physical activity... you know, just walkin' up them stairs or somethin'. It feels like there ain't enough air in here. My chest gets tight and it hurts a bit. Can't really describe it.

And then there's this sweat, Lord have mercy, it's like my body's tryin' to cool itself down too much. My face gets all flushed up too... I remember one time I was at the store and I must've gotten too hot 'cause I think I might've fainted or somethin'. My grandkids always say I'm gettin' old, but I don't feel that old... yet.

Oh boy, I got another thing. Them yeast infections, they just won't quit! It's like my body's playin' a trick on me. I swear, it's like a cycle: use the cream, feel better for a bit, and then it comes back again. My doctor friend said somethin' about Candida... didn't quite catch what he said, but I know it's related to them infections.

Now where was I? Ah yes, breathin'. It gets worse when I'm doin' exercise or exertin' myself too much. And sometimes at night, I'll wake up and my chest will be hurtin', like someone's pressin' on it... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the mountains with my sister? Lovely place..."
259,diabetes,I have persistent dry cough. My infections dont seem to be healing and I have palpitations. I also have this problem of sore throat that does seem to go away,"I've been having this dry cough, you know... been bothering me for weeks now. I was at my granddaughter's birthday party last week, and I remember we had those new-fangled balloons that were supposed to be extra loud, but they just made my throat feel worse. Anyway... my infections don't seem to be healing like they should. I've had this cold since... well, I think it started in January? Or was it February? Oh dear, anyway... and then there's these palpitations. My heart beats so fast, it feels like a jackrabbit in my chest. And that sore throat of mine... it just comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it's gone for days, but then suddenly it's back, like a bad penny.","I'm gettin' these awful dry coughs now, been goin' on for... um... I don't know, weeks? Months? It feels like forever! And my infections, they just won't heal no matter what the doctor gives me. I swear, I've had bronchitis three times already this year... (pauses) Wait, was it three or four? Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up...

And these palpitations, Doc says they're arrhythmia or somethin', but I know what I feel: my heart's racin' like a jackrabbit! I could swear I felt that before... (chuckles) Shoot, now I remember when I was a young'un and we'd go on them long hikes in the woods. My grandma used to say, ""You're just gettin' all lightheaded from too much fresh air!"" (laughs) Oh dear, what was I talkin' about?

Now, this sore throat... it comes and goes like the seasons! (pauses) You know what? I think I had that flu one year... or maybe it was two years ago? Shoot, my mind's gettin' all foggy! Anyway, the sore throat doesn't last too long, but it always comes back. And then there's this dry cough... Ugh! (coughs) Ah, pardon me!

Now where did I put that recipe for my grandmother's goulash? (pauses) Oh dear, never mind that now. Like I was sayin', these symptoms, they're gettin' all jumbled up in my head! (laughs)"
260,diabetes,"I'm drinking more water and urinating more frequently. My throat and mouth are frequently dry. Recently, my appetite and hunger have both grown.","Now let me think... I've been drinkin' more water, and boy oh boy, you'd think that'd help with the bathroom trips, right? But nope! I'm gettin' up in the middle of the night to pee like it's nobody's business. My throat's as dry as the Sahara desert, and my mouth feels like it's got sandpaper in it. You know, I was talkin' to Margaret at bridge club... or was it bingo? Anyway, she said her sister had that same problem, but she got some kind of... you know, medication... (pauses) Oh yes! Her appetite's increased too! And I mean, really, my stomach's always grumblin' now. Hunger's never been a problem for me, and I'm startin' to feel like I could eat a whole elephant. Hmm... what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the water... (trails off)","I'm drinking so much water now... (pauses) You know, my niece was just here and she said I should drink more water, so I've been doing that. And, oh boy, it seems like every five minutes I need to go to the bathroom! (chuckles) My poor old bladder's working overtime, you know? (laughs) Sorry, what was I saying? Ah yes, urination... anyway...

My throat's always dry, and my mouth too. I put some of that Vaseline on it, but it doesn't seem to help much. And the doctor said... (pauses, searching for words) What was his name, uh, Johnson or something? Anyway, he said I should try that other stuff – what's it called, you know, the one with the glycerin? Glycerol? No, no, it's not that...

My appetite and hunger... well, they're both increased, you see. (pauses) Just like my niece said! Eat more often, I suppose. But now I'm hungry all the time. (laughs) Like when I was a young woman, working on the farm. Oh boy, those were hard days! We didn't eat as much back then... but we had to, you know? Worked from dawn till dusk... (trails off)

Anyway, my appetite's increased, and so is hunger... it's all quite... perplexing, I suppose. Maybe it's just this new medication... I don't know. Do people take medications for their appetite, do you think? (pauses) Hmm...

Oh, I remember! My sister used to have that problem too – with her appetite, not the bathroom, of course. No, no, she'd eat a whole pie in one sitting! (laughs) Well, we all laughed about it... Ah, yes... what was I saying? Oh dear, my mind's gone blank again!"
261,diabetes,"My vision is foggy, and it seems to be growing worse. I'm constantly feeling worn out and exhausted. Additionally, I occasionally have severe lightheadedness and dizziness.","You know, my vision is all foggy now... been getting worse, I think. Or was it last week? No, no, must've been this morning. Anyway, everything looks like it's under a layer of haze. And Lord have mercy, I'm so tired. Can't seem to catch my breath. Worn out, that's the word. Like an old car with flat tires. Remember when our neighbor's son used to take his old '55 Chevy in for tune-ups? Poor thing was always breaking down... (pauses) What was I saying?

Oh yes, fatigue. It comes and goes, but lately, it's like I'm running on fumes. And these spells of dizziness... oh dear, they're getting worse too. Can't even get out of bed without feeling like the room is spinning. Lightheadedness, my daughter-in-law calls it. (pauses again) Now, what day was it? Ah yes, today's Wednesday, I think. Anyway, that's what's been going on with me... or at least, I'm pretty sure.","Oh boy, I don't know if this is just age catchin' up with me or what... my vision, you see, it's like tryin' to look through a misty window. Foggy, that's the word. And it's gettin' worse, I'm afraid. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishin' on Lake Michigan? Beautiful day, caught a big ol' trout... anyway...

My eyes, they just don't seem to focus right no more. Can't see my grandkids' faces clear as day no more. It's like tryin' to read the newspaper with them fancy tiny print. (chuckles) I remember when newspapers were actual paper, not all digital and whatnot... Ah yes, so my vision... it's just gettin' worse.

And then there's this tiredness. Lord have mercy, I'm more exhausted than a mule on a hot summer day. Can't even walk from the kitchen to the livin' room without feelin' like I've been run over by a truck. (laughs) My wife always says I'm just lazy, but... (trails off)

Now, this dizziness, it's more of a spell than anything. Like when I get up too fast or somethin'. My head starts spinning like that carnival ride I used to take the grandkids on. Severe, my doctor told me severe lightheadedness. Not just dizzy, but... (pauses) Did I tell you about my brother's wedding? Beautiful ceremony... anyway...

And then there's this one time when I was at the post office... or was it the bank? Wait, no, that's not right... (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all sorts of mixed up. Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. So, foggy vision, tiredness, and this dizziness business... just thought I'd mention it to you, Doc..."
262,diabetes,My throat and mouth are dry. I've also been feeling more hungry and more hungry. But sometimes I do feel quite exhausted.,"""Doc... my throat and mouth are so dry. I've been drinking water, but it don't seem to help much. You know, I remember when I was a kid, we didn't have all these fancy waters like they do now. My grandmother used to make us tea from this bush outside her house... anyway... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my throat. And you see, I've been feeling more hungry than usual. No, not just hungry... hungrier and hungrier. It's like my stomach is growling all the time. My sister-in-law Edna always says I'm eating too much for lunch, but... (trails off) What was that thing I had to eat yesterday? You know, with the cheese sauce... (chuckles) Ah, it'll come to me. Oh dear, sometimes I feel just exhausted. Like I could sleep all day...""","You know, Doc... (pauses) My throat and mouth are dry, like sandpaper... (stammers) I mean, have you ever tried drinking a glass of water when your mouth is that parched? It just sorta... slides right down, ya know? (chuckles)

And then there's this other thing. I've been feeling more hungry lately. More hungry than usual, I should say. Sometimes it's like my stomach's growling at me to eat something, and sometimes... well, sometimes not so much. But when it does happen, I get these... (pauses) cravin's. Yes, that's the word! Cravin's for sandwiches or soup, you know?

Now, let me think about this... (stares off into space) What were we talkin' about again? Ah yes! My symptoms. So, after I eat something, I do feel a bit better, but sometimes... (pauses, looks confused) what was it I wanted to say? Oh dear!

Oh yes, exhaustion! That's another thing. Sometimes I feel quite exhausted, like I've been runnin' for miles or somethin'. But then other times, I have so much energy... like when I'm watchin' my grandkids play outside on a sunny day. (smiles) They're such bundles of joy!

Now where did I put that recipe book? I could swear I left it right here on the... (pauses, looks around the room) Oh dear, now what was I sayin'? Ah yes! My symptoms. So, if you take my dry mouth and this hunger business, and add a dash of exhaustion... well, that's me these days, Doc."
263,diabetes,I have a sluggish wound and reduced healing rate. My hands and feet are both numb and have this tingling sensation.,"I'm havin' trouble with this wound on my leg... don't know how long it's been there now... seems like a month or two, maybe more? Anyways, it's just not healin' right. It's like, slow as molasses. And these numbness and tinglin' sensations in my hands and feet... it started with my toes, I think? No, wait, was it my fingers first? Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up. Anyway, my hands feel like they're asleep all the time. Like pins and needles. You know how that is. My grandkids were over last week, and we had the most wonderful time playin' Scrabble... anyway... yes, numbness and tinglin', just awful.","I don't know if I mentioned this before... (pauses) Oh, dearie me, I think I did, though... Anyway, my wound... it's been a bit of a slog, hasn't healed properly. (chuckles to herself) Like that one time I got a cut on my finger and it took forever to close up.

Oh, where was I? Ah yes, the wound. It's just not healing like it should be. My hands and feet... they're both numb now, you see. Felt like pins and needles, but more like... (pauses, searching for words) More like a buzzing sensation, like my nerves are all wobbly. And it's not just them, I think it might be... (hesitates) Oh dear, did I get a cold shot or something? No, no, that was years ago.

But, as I was saying... this numbness. It started in my hands and feet, but now it's spreading up to my elbows and knees. Don't know if you can call it arthritis or whatnot. My sister's husband had arthritis real bad... (gets distracted) Oh, I just remembered! We went to the beach last summer and saw the most lovely seagulls...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the numbness. And this tingling sensation... like my skin is alive and trying to tell me something. Don't know if it's related to the wound or what, but it's been going on for weeks now. (pauses, confused) Wait a minute, did you ask about my medications? I'm taking that blood pressure pill..."
264,diabetes,"I struggle to focus and have emotional swings. At times, my head seems cloudy and foggy, making it challenging for me to do even simple tasks.","Well, you know what they say about... apples? No, wait, that's not it... uh, anyway, I've been having some trouble with my brain lately. Focusin', ya know? It's like tryin' to watch TV with a lot of static. Can't quite get the picture clear. (pauses) Oh, I remember now! We went to the early bird special at Denny's last week, and I thought about gettin' the pancakes, but then I saw this little fella... (chuckles) Sorry, where was I? Ah yes, focusin'. It's been like that for a while now. And them emotional swings? Lord have mercy! One minute I'm happy as a clam, and the next... (shakes head) Well, let's just say I've had to clean up after myself more than once. Head feels cloudy, foggy... like tryin' to find my way outta the house without my glasses on. Even simple tasks, like makin' a sandwich or somethin', it's all just a big mess. Now what was that one thing I forgot? (pauses again) Oh dearie me...","Oh dearie me... Focusin' is gettin' harder for me. Can't seem to concentrate no more. (pauses) You know what I did yesterday? Went to the market with Edna, and we got the most wonderful rhubarb pie. She makes it from scratch. Always has a little too much sugar in it, but it's... um... Oh yes! Focusin'!

I'm gettin' these awful mood swings, doctor. One minute I'm fine, next thing you know, I'm cryin' like a baby over nothin'. (chuckles) You remember that time we took the grandkids to the zoo? They loved seein' those monkeys swingin' from tree to tree... Just like my mind these days! All cloudy and foggy. Can't even do simple things no more.

Foggy, I tell ya! Like tryin' to read a book and the words just blend together. (pauses) Now where did I put that darn pen? Ah yes! Focusin'... or lack thereof. Simple tasks, like cookin' dinner, it's like tryin' to solve a puzzle blindfolded. (laughs)

You know what they say, ""If you don't use it, you lose it."" My mind's gettin' all rusty. I can still remember where I put my keys... in 1992. (giggles) Sorry, sorry! Got sidetracked there.

Anyway, doc, like I was sayin', focusin' is a problem. And this foggy business? Makes me feel all... (pauses, searching for the right word)... woozy-woozy."
265,diabetes,I feel my muscles trembling and shaking. I feel worn out and my senses of taste and smell have diminished. Sometimes I have palpitations or a quick heartbeat.,"""Oh dear, doc... my muscles, you see... they're just trembling and shaking like a leaf. Can't even hold a cup of tea steady no more. And I'm so worn out, all the time. Can barely get up from the couch, if you know what I mean. Now, where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes, the one with my famous apple pie... (chuckles) My grandkids just love it.

Now, as for this business about taste and smell... (pauses) Well, I don't know if it's just me getting older or what, but everything tastes like cardboard and smells like... well, I'm not even sure how to describe it. Like nothing at all. And those palpitations? Quick heartbeat, you call it? Oh my stars, it's like my heart's trying to escape from my chest! (giggles) Just like that time I saw a wild deer on our farm...

And when was the last time this happened, exactly? Was it... uh... yesterday? Or was it last week? Ah dear, my memory's not what it used to be... (sighs) Anyway, it's been happening more often than not, if you know what I mean...""","I don't know if it's this chair I'm sittin' in... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my muscles, they're all trembly and shaky, like a leaf on a windy day. No, wait, it's not that bad, but I can feel 'em vibrate, ya know? (chuckles) My grandkids used to love vibratin' spoons back in the... uh, was it 1952 or... no, never mind.

Anyway, where was I? Oh yes, my muscles. It's like they're all tired out or somethin'. And then there's this feelin' of weariness. Not just my legs and arms, but my whole body feels drained, ya hear me? (pauses) Now, what were we talkin' about again?

Now that I think on it, I remember when I was younger... (chuckles) My taste buds used to be so sharp! I could tell a ripe strawberry from a green one just by smellin'. But now, my taste and smell are all... muffled. Like someone's puttin' cotton balls in my ears and nose. (shakes head) Ah well.

And then there's this racin' heart business. Quick heartbeat, they call it? (laughs nervously) I swear, when I was a young whippersnapper, I could outrun the town's fastest runner! Now, I get winded just goin' up the stairs... (pauses, takes deep breath) Excuse me, where's my water glass?

266,diabetes,"I experience skin irritations and rashes, especially in my skin's creases. Any wounds and bruises I have on my skin also heal quite slowly.","""Ah, yes, you see... I've been gettin' these skin irritations, all sorts of rashes and whatnot. Especially in my creases, ya know? Wrists, elbows, knees... that sorta thing. (pauses) Oh, remember when I was at the store last week? I bought a new loaf of bread, and it was on sale! Can't even recall now if it was whole wheat or white... anyway... (chuckles) Ah yes, so these rashes. They're quite... uncomfortable.

And them wounds, they just won't heal like they used to. Bruises take forever to go away too. I had this big ol' bruise on my leg from when I fell last month, and it's still here!

Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes! So, my skin gets these irritations and rashes. Especially in the folds, you know? Like here (taps on arm) and here (taps on neck). Can't remember when it started, but it's been going on for years now.

Now, let me think... what was I saying? Ah yes! The skin stuff. It's like, well... have you seen those ads for creams and lotions? My daughter swears by that Nivea something. But no, mine don't work like that. (chuckles) They just sort of... stay.

And then there are the wounds. Oh boy, I've got a few now that just won't heal! (muttering to self) Like that scrape on my knee last year... or was it this year? Anyway, they just seem to take forever. My grandson's teacher says something about collagen in your skin and how that affects healing... (pauses) Wait, what were we talking about?

Oh, yes! The rashes. I've tried... uh... calamine lotion on them once. No, twice. But it didn't help much, I'm afraid. Maybe I should take a picture for you? To show how... (stops suddenly)

What's that noise? (listens to outside sound) Oh dear, the vacuum cleaner's going again. Anyway... where was I? Ah yes! My skin problems. It's just a bother, is all. Can't even go out without feeling self-conscious about it anymore."
267,diabetes,I frequently feel the want to urinate and frequently have these strong cravings. I frequently feel woozy and bewildered. I've also had sight loss.,"You know, doc...

So, it's this... urinating business. Constantly feel like I gotta go, even after I just went. Like there's always something in my bladder, you know? And then these... cravings. Strong ones. For sweets, mostly. I swear, my tongue's on fire sometimes from all the sugar.

Feeling woozy and bewildered, that's a new one for me. Don't recall ever feeling like this before... (pauses) Now what was I saying? Ah yes! And then there's my vision. Getting harder to see things far away. Can you believe it? My eyes used to be as sharp as the day is long...

By the way, what time is it? Is it lunchtime already?","I... uh... you know what I'm sayin'? I get these urges, ya see... gotta pee all the time. Can't sit still no more. Always feel like I gotta run to the bathroom. And then there's them cravings... strong ones. Like my stomach's growlin', but not for food, ya hear me? It's somethin' else. (pauses) You know, I had a dog once named Bingo... good boy, that one was...

Anyway... where was I? Ah yes, the symptoms. (chuckles) So, like I said, gotta pee all the time, and these cravings. And then there's this wooziness... feelin' light-headed, dizzy. Can't focus no more. Feels like my head's spinning in circles. And what's that other thing... oh yeah, bein' bewildered. Don't know what I'm doin', ya see? (laughs) Like when I was a kid and we used to play checkers with my cousin...

And then there's this sight loss... started about six months ago, maybe longer. Can't read the newspaper no more without strainin' me eyes. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went fishin' on Lake Michigan? Caught a big ol' catfish... must've been twenty pounds... (trails off)

What was I sayin'? Oh yeah, the symptoms. So, like I said, gotta pee all the time, these cravings, wooziness, and bein' bewildered. And this sight loss, of course. (pauses again) You know what I think it is?... I don't know... probably just my age catchin' up with me... (laughs) Yeah, that's it!"

Yeast infections, I've had a few too many lately.","Doc... (pauses) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all worked up just thinkin' about it. Trouble breathin', yeah, that's right. When I exercise, or even just walkin' up them stairs at my granddaughter's house, I gotta catch my breath like a fish out of water. (chuckles) Fish outta water, ain't that somethin'? My cousin Ed had a pet goldfish named... uh... Bubbles? (pauses) No, no, it was his dog.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, trouble breathin'. And then there's this flushin' business. Sweatin', too much sweat, like when you eat that spicy food and your face gets all red. (taps forehead) But mine's not just my face, it's... uh... down below the neck. You know what I mean? My skin feels on fire, but no fever, no temperature or anything.

Now, I also get these yeast infections... (hesitates) Oh boy, don't even remind me about 'em! They're so annoying, like a cold that won't go away. Used to be just the occasional one, but now it seems like every other month, if not sooner. Can't say it's because of this breathin' problem or the sweatin', but...

Now, these palpitations of mine... they come and go, but lately, they've been comin' more often. And my infections just won't clear up! I had this nasty cold last month, and it seemed to linger forever. My throat's been a problem too... achy, sore... you know? But sometimes it goes away on its own for a few days, so that's some consolation, I suppose.

What was the name of that other medication again?","I'm so sorry to bother you again, doc... I just can't seem to shake this dry cough... (pauses) Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, my cough! It's been going on for months now, and I just can't get rid of it no matter what I do. (sighs)

You know, I had the most wonderful gardenia bush in my backyard when I was younger... reminded me of my mother every time I smelled its blooms... (trails off) Anyway...

As I was saying, this cough is driving me crazy! And then there's these palpitations... (pauses to think) Wait, what were they again? Ah yes, palpitations! It feels like my heart is skipping beats or something. I get them in the mornings after breakfast, especially if I've had a cup of coffee... (chuckles)

Now, about this throat issue... it's been acting up for months too. Sometimes it hurts so much it feels like there's glass in there... but then, just as suddenly, it goes away! It's all very puzzling, isn't it? (laughs) I swear, some mornings I wake up thinking I had a perfectly normal night's sleep, only to realize I must have turned over wrong or something. My wife says it's just the years catching up with me... (sighs)

You see, my doc, I've been seeing you for quite some time now, and we've talked about this before... but I'm starting to worry that these symptoms are connected somehow... like a puzzle piece I just can't quite fit in place. That dry cough always seems to come first... followed by the palpitations... and then the throat issue kicks in. It's all very confusing! (laughs again) Oh dear, what am I getting myself into today?"

I've been drinking so much water lately. I mean, I'm sippin' on it all day long. And then I gotta get up in the middle of the night, multiple times, you know? Like three or four times.

(pauses) You know, I was at the park yesterday, and I saw this young couple... they were so happy, holding hands... anyway... my mouth's always dry, feels like the Sahara desert. And my appetite... oh boy, I'm always hungry! I mean, I'm eating more than usual, but I just can't seem to stop thinkin' about food...

(chuckles) Used to be, my wife would always say, ""Hank, slow down on the tea!"" But now... (trails off) Oh yes, tea. I had a nice cup of Earl Grey just yesterday. Reminded me of our anniversary, 1962... No, no, it was '62, wasn't it? (laughs nervously)

Anyway... frequency of urination. Well, let's just say I'm making more trips to the bathroom than ever before. (chuckles) My wife always said, ""You're going in and out like a yo-yo!"" (laughs) Ahah, good times.

Dry mouth, dry throat... (pauses, looks around the room) Now where did I put my teeth? Ah yes, here they are. (holds up false teeth) See? All clean and shiny. My daughter-in-law said I should get dentures with a built-in cup holder... (chuckles) Oh dear...

Appetite... (hesitates) Well, I've been eating more, that's for sure. But is it because I'm hungry or just bored? (laughs) You know what they say: ""An idle mind is the devil's plaything!"" (smiling)

I think my stomach's been growling a lot lately. No, wait, that's just... (pauses) Oh yes! My stomach's been acting up since I ate that big ol' plate of chicken at church potluck last Sunday... (mumbles to himself) Should've stuck with the veggies...

I've been having this blurry vision business for a while now. Can't quite put my finger on when it started, but I'm pretty sure it was after that big storm last month... or was it the one before?

Just got back from a walk with Edna last week... nice day, too... nice lady. Where was I? Ah yes, lightheadedness and vertigo.

It's been getting worse, I think. Or is that better? Wait, what was the question again? Oh, yes! My vision. It's hard to focus on things, especially during the day. You know, when you go out and about... (pauses) Did I get my library card renewed this month? Hmm...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, fatigue. That's another thing entirely. I feel like I'm runnin' a marathon all the time, but without any of the, uh, exercise benefits. (chuckles) Just me, trudgin' along like an old mule. Can't seem to catch my breath either... no matter how much rest I get. My legs just feel heavy, like lead pipes.

Now and then, when I stand up too quick or turn my head... (giggles) Oh dear, it's funny really! – I get this lightheadedness thing. Dizzy spells, my friend Edna used to call 'em. I think she had one of those new-fangled pill thingies for it? What was the name...? (trails off) And sometimes when I walk around, it feels like the floor is spinning underneath me! Like a merry-go-round, but without the music... or fun.

Anyway... that's what I've been experiencin', Doc. Or was it experience-ing? Hmm... (laughs softly)"

Like when I was at my sister's house last week, and we were playing bingo... anyway, they had those awful crackers that just sat there. Made my mouth feel like a desert.

Ah yes, I'm tired too... worn out, that's the word... just like when I used to walk to school uphill both ways... now where did I put my glasses?","Mouth and throat are dry... like sandpaper.

And then there's the hunger. I mean, not just wanting a sandwich or something, but really hungry. Like, I think about food all day long. Which reminds me, I was talking to my neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins, yesterday... (stammers) what were we discussing again? Ah yes, her garden! She has the most lovely roses this time of year.

Now, where was I? Oh right, feeling worn out. It's not just fatigue, you know. It's like carrying a heavy weight all day long. I get these moments... (pauses, collecting thoughts) when I'm watching TV or reading a book, and suddenly I feel like crawling into bed. Not tired, mind you, but like my body's given up on me.

The important thing is it's not healin'. And you know what else is botherin' me? My hands and feet. They're all numb and tinglin' at the same time, like ants crawlin' under my skin. I've had this before, I think... or was it my aunt Mabel? Wait, no, it wasn't her... (pauses) Ah dear, anyway...

(Impatient sigh)

Oh, right! My hands and feet. Like I said, numb and tinglin', all the time. Can't seem to do much with 'em either.

(pauses) I think it was from a fall, yeah? Down the stairs. No, wait, was it up the stairs? Anyway, it's been a while, and it just won't heal right. Slow as molasses, if you know what I mean.

(tangent) Did I tell you about our trip to Florida last year? Oh boy, those alligators! (chuckles) I swear, they were staring at us. My goodness gracious...

Where was I? Ah yes, the numbness and tingling... in my hands and feet, it is. At the same time, mind you. Can't even feel my toes anymore. It's like a pins-and-needles feeling all over. (pauses) Did I take my medications today? (looks around) Wait, where did I put them?

(rambling) Now, let me think... my wound. Healing slowly, that's what I said. Slower than usual. Maybe it's those new shoes I bought? No, no, not the shoes... (laughs nervously)

Now, I remember! My husband, he had something like this once. Arthritis or something... (struggles to recall) Oh dear me, what was it called again?

Like I'm stuck in a desert or somethin'. And my hunger pangs... oh dearie me, they're gettin' worse, not better. I swear, just yesterday, maybe it was last week, I was havin' a nice cup of tea with my granddaughter... anyway, she's been helpin' me with the garden... ah yes! My garden's lookin' lovely this time of year. Um, what was I sayin'? Oh right, hunger pangs. And then there's this... fatigue thingy. I get so tired out of nowhere. Can't even remember what I'm doin'. It's like my batteries are runnin' low, you know? But I'm not old, no sir! Still got a lot of life in me... probably.""","I don't know if this is related... but I had the most peculiar dream last night, you see. I was at my cousin Edna's house, and she was making a big ol' dinner, just like she used to when we were young. (pauses) Wait, what were we talking about again? Oh yes, my throat and mouth. They're as dry as the Sahara desert, I swear. Can't swallow without gagging, you know. It's like my body's trying to suck all the moisture outta me.

Now, let's see... where did I put that list of medications I'm supposed to take? Ah yes! (rummages through papers) Here it is! Now, what were we discussing? Oh right, my symptoms! (chuckles) So, this dryness in my mouth and throat. And on top of that, I've been getting these hunger pangs... no, not just pangs – full-blown growls! I mean, I'm hungry all the time now. Like a bottomless pit, you know? (laughs)

And then there's this exhaustion business... feels like someone's siphoning my energy out with a straw, that one. Now, what was it we used to say about our favorite foods when we were young? ""Fish on Fridays"" or something? (trails off) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up! Anyway, the point is, I feel... tired. Very tired.

You know, speaking of food, have you tried those new biscuits at the market? They're just like my Aunt Mabel used to make... (stops abruptly) What was it we were talking about again?"
283,diabetes,My wound is recovering more slowly now. Both my hands and feet are tingling and going numb. I feel very weak,"You know, doc... my wound, well, it's just not healing like I thought it would. Been a few weeks now, maybe more? Can't keep track of days no more. Anyway, I had a nice cup of tea with the ladies from the church last week, and we talked about our grandkids... anyway...

Oh, right, my wound! It's still sore, but that's not what bothers me. My hands and feet, they're tingling something fierce now. Can't feel my toes half the time, it's like I'm walking on blocks or somethin'. And my fingers, same thing, numb as a piece of wood. Weak, too... can barely pick up the newspaper without gettin' winded. Don't know what's wrong with me...

Oh, and I almost forgot! My niece's birthday is next week, I need to send her a card... or was it my sister? Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, I feel weak, too much strain on my heart, I reckon. You'd think by now...","Oh dear, my wound... (pauses) you know, I was just thinking about that nice dinner we had at the church potluck last week. The chicken casserole, wasn't it...? (chuckles) Oh, anyway...

My wound is recovering more slowly now. Both my hands and feet are tingling and going numb. It's like pins and needles, but not just a little bit, you know? More like... (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh, I remember that one time I fell on the ice and got frostbite. Same feeling. (trails off)

I feel very weak, too. Can't hardly lift my fork, let alone carry the groceries. My grandson Jimmy's always helping me with those now. Good boy, he is... (gets sidetracked) Did I tell you about the time we went to the lake and caught a big ol' fish? That was 1952, wasn't it?

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my hands and feet. It's like they're asleep or something. Numb, tingling... Can't even feel my fingers sometimes when I'm trying to do the crossword puzzle. (stares off into space) Crossword puzzles... I used to love those...

And another thing, I had a dream last night. Or was it this morning? About being in a big field of wheat and running from something. Always felt like that as a kid, though. (laughs vaguely) Wheat, yes...

Oh dear, what was the question again? Oh no, wait! My wound..."
284,diabetes,"My emotions change, and I have difficulties focusing. At times, my mind might be cloudy and hazy, making it challenging for me to do even simple tasks.","I don't know if I'm explainin' this right, but... my emotions, they change like the weather, you know? One minute I'm fine, next thing I know I'm cryin' for no reason at all. And then there's them focusin' problems... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the market and forgot what I was buyin'? (chuckles) Ah, yes, anyway...

At times my mind is just cloudy, hazy, like a fog has rolled in. Simple tasks, like makin' lunch or takin' my meds... it's like tryin' to solve a puzzle blindfolded. Can't seem to get 'em done no matter how hard I try. (pauses, looking around the room) Now, where was I? Oh yes...

I swear I wrote down some reminders on that calendar thingy, but now I'm forgettin' what they were... (trails off)","I don't know if I'm doing this right... Emotions change, you see? My emotions change like the weather, can't predict 'em no more. One minute I'm fine, next minute... (pauses) You know what I was just thinking about? Tomatoes! We had those lovely cherry tomatoes last summer at Bob's garden party. Anyway...

Focusin' troubles me too. Sometimes my mind's cloudy and hazy like a foggy morning on the lake. Simple tasks become chores. Can't even remember where I put my... uh, keys? Was it in the kitchen or... no, that's not right. (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old.

I was tellin' Bob about it, and he said maybe I should see... you know, Dr. someone-or-other. Yeah, they're always sayin' somethin'. But what were we talkin' about again? Oh right, my mind! It's like tryin' to grasp a handful of sand – slips right through your fingers.

I was thinkin', maybe it's just because I'm gettin' up there in years... (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I met President Kennedy? (laughs) No, no, that's not important. My point is... I don't know what my point is. (chuckles)

Simple tasks, like cookin' dinner or takin' a shower... those seem to be okay most of the time. But other things, like payin' bills or rememberin' appointments... forget about it! It's like I'm tryin' to solve a puzzle blindfolded.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, emotions and focus. I think that's all I wanted to say... for now, at least."

And my taste buds... well, they seem to have gone on vacation, if you know what I mean. Can't enjoy a good cup of coffee or soup no more. Same with smells, completely lost 'em. Now, let me think... where was I? Ah yes, tiredness. Lord have mercy, I'm exhausted all the time. And then there's this thing with my heart... racing like it's tryin' to get away from me. Palpitations, they call it, right? Like a rabbit in my chest.""","You know, Doc... my whole body's just shakin' like a leaf, I swear. Can't seem to stop it neither.

Tremblin', like a leaf, I said.

(Stammers) Taste and smell, gone. Can't taste nothin', can't smell a thing. You know how it is when you're cookin' dinner, and the aroma just fills up the whole kitchen? (chuckles to self) Oh boy... (pauses) Ah yes, my nose's not workin'. My tongue's as dry as the Sahara desert.

Gettin' these palpitations, too. Heart starts racin' like a jackrabbit on Red Bull. Can't catch my breath neither. Doc, you know that one time I went to see... uh... what was her name? (snaps fingers) Oh dear, it's on the tip of my tongue! Ah yes, Sister Mary Margaret! She had this fancy heart monitor thingy... (trails off)

(Interrupts self) Wait a minute! What were we talkin' about again? (laughs) Ah yes, my shakin' body. Can't seem to stop it. Worn out, too. I mean, I'm an old man now. Maybe that's just it. (chuckles) Gettin' old ain't no picnic..."

Must've been... uh... the 70s? No, was it the 80s? Anyway... (chuckles)

Oh, sorry about that. As I was sayin', cuts and bruises take a while to heal. Like my neighbor's daughter had that accident last week... or was it two weeks ago? (laughs) Oh dear, I get confused sometimes! Ah, yes, my skin issues. It seems like they've gotten worse since... hmmm... let me see... we moved into this new house three years ago? Maybe four? Time flies when you're havin' fun, don't it?

Anyway, my doctor friend... (pauses) What was his name again? Ah yes! Dr. Johnson! He said I needed to take some cream for the dry skin. (hesitates) But this is different... these irritations and rashes...","I... uh... I think it started when I was gardening last summer. The tomatoes were doing all right, but those zucchini plants just wouldn't cooperate... anyway, where was I? Oh yes, my skin. It gets all irritated and rashy-like. Especially in the creases, you know, like between my toes and under my arms.

I remember my mother used to get something similar when she'd be out in the sun too long... or maybe it was just her shins? Wait, no... I'm sure it was her skin. Anyway, she'd say, ""Don't worry, dear, it's just the sun beating down on you."" (pauses) What was that song we used to listen to on the radio? You know, the one with ""la la"" in the title? Never mind... (chuckles)

Now, where did I go off track? Ah yes! My cuts and bruises. They take an awful long time to heal. And it's not just my age, either – I'm not that old, am I? (laughs) Oh dear me, what was I saying? Cuts and bruises... I remember when my grandchild fell off his bike and cut his knee. Took him weeks to stop limpin' around...

Uh-oh, where did I put those reading glasses? Must be in the other room... or is it upstairs? Anyway, like I said – my skin gets all irritated and takes forever to heal. (pauses) Tomatoes. Do you grow tomatoes in... uh... what's that thing called? A greenhouse?"

You know, like a craving for... (trails off)

Oh dear, what were we talking about again? Ah yes, my health. So, as I was saying... I get woozy quite often, too dizzy to walk across the room without holding onto something. My granddaughter's wedding was last weekend, and I had to sit down in the middle of the ceremony because I felt like I was spinning around in circles. (pauses) Did I tell you about my granddaughter's wedding? It was lovely... Anyway...

Now, let me think... What else did we talk about? Oh yes! My vision! (laughs) Well, it's not what it used to be, if you know what I mean. Can't see the TV without my reading glasses, and even then... (pauses) You know, I had a pair of glasses just like those once. Now, where did I put them? Ah yes, in the drawer... (gets distracted)

Anyway... My vision's gone downhill, if you ask me. I've been squinting for years now, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Maybe we can talk about some of those new-fangled glasses or contacts, eh doc?"

Now, these infections, you see... yeast and urinary tract... they just seem to come up all the time. Been gettin' those little white patches on my tongue again. And them UTIs, well... it's like my bladder's got a mind of its own. You'd think I was 20 years younger, doin' all these things that make me... (sighs) Oh, I'm so sorry, doctor. Where was I?

And then, there's this flushin' business. One minute I'm fine, next thing I know, I'm sweatin' like a pig. Don't know what's causin' it, but... uh... must be the heat or somethin'. Get me all flustered up. Like that time I went to see my sister in Florida... hot as blazes there! *chuckles* Ah, yes...

Anyway, as I was sayin', this breathin' trouble. And them yeast infections, oh boy... they just keep comin' back. Got one about six months ago, and another a few weeks after that. My husband, he says it's 'cause I'm not eatin' enough yogurt no more. *laughs* But then there's the urinary tract... always gettin' those too. Felt like I had some water in my kidney last week, or was it two weeks ago? *pauses* Shoot...

You know what might be helpful, though? Maybe one of them new gadgets for helpin' with breathin'? Saw somethin' on TV about a... a device for COPD or something. Don't rightly remember the name, but I'll think on it some more. Yes, that's it! Or maybe we could just get some yogurt? *laughs*"

Had a cough then too, from all the blowing. (trails off)

Now, my heart... it beats funny sometimes. Palpitations, the doctor said. Or was it Mr. Johnson who said that? No matter. It feels like it's skipping beats or something. Like when I'm walking up the stairs and suddenly I'm out of breath. You know how that is. (pauses) Where's my tea? Oh dear...

These infections... I've been having so many lately. Don't seem to be getting better, if you ask me. My throat hurts sometimes, but it always seems to clear up on its own. Well, most times. This one time... no, wait, that was when I had the flu. (confused) Or was it my sister who had the flu? She's been coming over a lot lately...

It's like my body's tryin' to get rid of somethin', but I'm not sure what.

Now, about this dry mouth and throat business... (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I tried that new toothpaste? No, no, it doesn't matter. My tongue feels like sandpaper, if you know what I mean. Can't even swallow without thinkin' about water. That's just the truth of it.

Appetite and hunger... (chuckles) Oh boy, have those increased somethin' fierce! I'm eatin' like a bear right now.

Feelin' really fragile these days. Can't remember the last time I cooked myself dinner. My niece comes over more often now... lovely girl, by the way. Made me some chicken soup once, it was just like my mother used to make! (gets sidetracked) Speakin' of which, have you seen that new recipe book at the library?

And don't even get me started on the smell – it's like my nose is clogged up with cotton balls. And then there's this... this exhaustion. I just want to sit back and take a nap all day. Sometimes, when I'm getting ready for bed, my heart starts racing like it's got a mind of its own. Palpitations or somethin', that's what they're called... (pauses) Ah, yes! My neighbor's cat, Whiskers – she was gettin' into all sorts of trouble last night, knockin' over the trash cans again... Oh dear me, where was I?","I'm shakin' and trembly... all over. You know, like when I was a young'un, my grandma used to get them shakes somethin' fierce. We'd think she was just scared or upset, but now I remember... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the word I was lookin' for? Ah yes! My aunt Edna's husband had that too. Anyway... like I said, I'm shakin', and it's not just my hands no more. It's my whole body, you see.

Now, let me think on this... taste and smell, they're gone! Can't taste my coffee in the mornin', and don't even get me started on them smells from the garden. My neighbor, Mr. Jenkins, he's got some... some flowers or somethin' that's just awful! (chuckles) Ah, anyway...

And then there's this tiredness... it's like someone's drained all my energy. I mean, I used to be able to walk down to the corner store and back without gettin' winded. Nowadays, I'm huffin' and puffin' just gettin' from the couch to the kitchen! (laughs) Well, not that I'm complaining or nothin'.

Oh dear, what was the other thing? Ah yes! Palpitations... heart goin' a mile a minute! Like when I used to play baseball in school. We'd run around and think we were fit as fiddles, but really we were just... (trails off)

I'm so sorry, I'm gettin' all mixed up now... anyway, like I said, I've been feelin' these tremors, lost my taste and smell... and this heart of mine's goin' haywire! (pauses, looks around) You know what I just remembered? My cousin Betty had a brother who was... uh... what's the word I'm thinkin' of? Oh dear, it'll come to me eventually..."
296,diabetes,"Particularly in the crevices of my skin, I have skin rashes and irritations. My skin bruises and cuts take a while to heal as well.","""Ah, you see, Doctor... I've been gettin' these little rashes on my skin, particularly in the crevices, you know? Between the fingers, behind the knees... and they just won't go away! My wife says it's from the new soap I started usin', but I don't think that's it. Now, where was I? Ah yes, the rashes... And then there's the bruises and cuts. They take an eternity to heal, if you can believe it. I cut myself on the garden shears last week, and it still hasn't scabbed over yet. (pauses) You know, I used to be a carpenter, always had big ol' calluses on my hands... Anyway, as I was sayin', these skin problems of mine... I'm gettin' quite worried about 'em.""","I think I might have some trouble with my skin, Doctor... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, my skin. Now, let me tell you, it's been acting up something awful lately. Especially in those crevices of my skin, where the wrinkles are deep, you know? (chuckles) Like a map, I like to think... anyway, I get these rashes and irritations. I'm not sure what causes 'em, but they itch like crazy. And sometimes they bleed, poor things.

Now, about those bruises... (pauses again) Did I ever tell you about the time I fell off that ladder in my garden? No? Well, it was a while ago, but it left me with this big ol' bruise on my behind for weeks! (laughs) I'm sure it's not related, though. My skin just takes... (hesitates) longer to heal these days, I suppose.

Yes, and the cuts... oh dear, the cuts. They're like that one time I cut myself shaving, remember? (pauses once more) No, you wouldn't know about that, would you? (chuckles nervously) Anyway, they just take an awful long time to close up. My skin's all scabby and whatnot... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My skin! It's been acting up something fierce. Perhaps it's this new laundry detergent I started using... or maybe it's the weather? We did have a bit of a storm last week, didn't we? (confused) No, wait, that was last month...

In any case, Doctor, I think I need to do something about these skin troubles... (trails off into silence)"
297,diabetes,I regularly experience these intense urges and the want to urinate. I frequently feel drowsy and lost. I've also significantly lost my vision.,"I'm gettin' these... intense urges, ya know? To, uh, go to the bathroom right away. And I'm feelin' drowsy all the time. Lost, I'd say. Can't even remember what day it is half the time. My mind's a bit of a fog, if you will. (chuckles) Reminds me of that one time my grandson came over and we went to the park... anyway...

And then there's this other thing, where I wake up in the middle of the night and, oh boy, I gotta go so bad! Like right now, I gotta... uh... excuse me. (pauses) Ah yes, as I was sayin', my vision's gone downhill somethin' fierce. Can't even see the TV without it hurtin' my eyes.","I don't know if you'll understand what I'm sayin', but I've been gettin' these... these urges, like a need to go right now, ya know? And then I feel so sleepy, like my eyes just wanna shut and never open again. It's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin', but I don't know what.

My grandkids were here last week, and we watched that movie... you know the one with Tom Hanks? Anyway, after they left, I tried to cook myself some supper, but I must've dozed off 'cause the next thing I knew, the kitchen was filled with smoke. My son had to come over and put out the fire. He said I was just standin' there, staring at the wall... (pauses)

Now where was I? Ah yes, these urges. They're gettin' worse, doc. I'll be in the middle of doin' somethin', like readin' a book or watchin' TV, and suddenly I gotta go right that second. It's like my bladder's playin' tricks on me.

And then there's this... (taps forehead) forgetfulness thing. I was talkin' to my wife the other day, and I couldn't remember what we were sayin'. She said it was just my old age, but I'm not sure that's it. Maybe it's this other thing... you know, like a... uh... a... (pauses)

Oh dear me, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, vision! It's gettin' terrible, doc. Can barely see the TV anymore. And when I do try to read, everything's all blurry and wavy... like lookin' through water.

( mutters to self ) What was that recipe we used for roast chicken again? (pauses) Oh, never mind..."
298,diabetes,"I have trouble breathing, especially outside. I start to feel hot and start to sweat. I frequently have urinary tract infections and yeast infections.","Oh dear doctor... breathing troubles, you see... especially when I'm outside, that's when it hits me like a ton of bricks. Hot flashes, I think they call 'em? Yeah, get all hot and sweaty like a young'un in summer school. And then there's these urinary tract infections... just seems like every other week now, can't even remember the last time I didn't have one... (pauses) Oh, wait, what was I saying? Ah yes, UTIs! And yeast infections too, don't get me started on those... (chuckles) reminds me of my sister-in-law Edna, always getting those kinds of problems... anyway... I swear, it's like my body's against me. (pauses to collect thoughts) Anyway, the breathing troubles... that's what I'm worried about.","I'm having a bit of trouble catchin' my breath, especially when I'm outdoors. You know, in the park or somethin'. It's like... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the name of that place we went to last summer? Ah yes, the... uh... senior center! We had bingo there, and I won a prize. (chuckles) Anyway...

When I do get outside, I start feelin' all hot and sweaty. My shirt's always stickin' to my back. And I'm not just talkin' about the sun, neither. It's like... (hesitates) Have you seen those new-fangled air conditioners they got nowadays? Noisy contraptions, if you ask me.

Now, about this breathin' business... it gets worse if I walk up them stairs to my apartment. (pauses again) Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous three-layer Jell-O? Ah yes! My daughter was visitin', and she just loved it...

Oh, right. The breathing. It's like... (struggling to find the words) my chest feels all tight, like someone's squeezin' a rubber band around it. (pauses once more) I had the most wonderful conversation with that nice young man at the... uh... what was the name of that restaurant? Oh dear...

I also get these infections... (hesitates) You know, those urinary tract things and yeast infections. Awful business. My daughter's always tellin' me to take some sort of... cream or pill or somethin'. But I'm not sure it's really workin', if you want my honest opinion..."
299,diabetes,"I constantly sneeze and have a dry cough. My infections don't seem to be healing, and I have palpitations. My throat does ache occasionally, but it usually gets better.","I don't know if you'll remember what I said last time, but anyway... Sneezing, that's what it is. Can't stop sneezing. And this cough... it's dry, like sand in my throat. (pauses) You know, reminds me of when I was a kid, we used to have those dust storms out in the fields... (trails off)

Anyway, infections, they just won't go away. My grandson had something last week and I said, ""Oh, give it some tea, it'll be fine."" But nope... my throat's still sore. (pauses) Now what was that one thing? You know, the medication... oh dear, it starts with an M... (chuckles)

Palpitations, is that what they call it? My heart beats fast, like when I'm watching a baseball game and my team's winning. (laughs) Oh dear, I'm getting off track. So, palpitations, and my throat... it aches some days, but most days it's okay. Not too bad, anyway...","I don't know if I'm making a big deal out of this, but... (pauses) You see, doctor used to say my sinuses were always actin' up back in '75. Always got me with that one. (chuckles) Ah yes, sinus infections. Now I've been sneezin' nonstop, like it's the hay fever season or somethin'. Coughin' too... dry cough, it is. Can't seem to get nothin' down. Water just keeps goin' right back up. (pauses) Oh boy, now what was I talkin' about? Ah yes, my heart. It's been racin' like a teenager on a date. Palpitations, the doc would call it. Don't know if it's connected to... nothin', really.

And this throat business... now I know I told you before, but it does ache from time to time. But then it just seems to get better on its own, like it was never there in the first place. You'd think it would be more of a problem, but... (shrugs) what do I know? It's probably just my age catchin' up with me. All these... all these medications they got now. Can't keep track of 'em no more.

Wait, was that last night or the night before we had those nice folks over for dinner? You see, we had a lovely roast beef and— (stops suddenly) Ah yes, my symptoms! Now where did I put my notes on this... thing?"
0,Bronchial Asthma,"I have been feeling extremely tired and weak, and I've also been coughing a lot with difficulty breathing. My fever is very high, and I'm producing a lot of mucus when I cough.","Well, doc... (pauses) excuse me, I think you're Dr. Smith, but I'm not sure... (chuckles) anyway... I've been feelin' just awful lately. Been tired and weak, like I've been runnin' a marathon or somethin'. And this cough... oh boy, it's just gettin' worse. Makes me wheeze, you know? Like when I used to play with the grandkids at the park. (giggles) They'd always be askin' for more rides on the swing. (clears throat)

Now, where was I? Ah yes... the cough. It's got this mucus, and it's just... yuck! I'm gettin' all congested up here. (taps chest) Fever's through the roof, I'm pretty sure it's over a hundred... or is that Tuesday we're supposed to go see my sister? (laughs) Oh dear, anyway... high fever, lots of mucus... just feels like I've been hit by a truck, doc.","I've been feelin' so... tired. Can't seem to get out of bed no matter how hard I try. My legs just give out on me, ya know? And this coughing... (pauses) Oh boy, it's just killin' me. I'm coughin' and coughin', but not a drop of mucus comes out. Just air, like I'm blowin' on a whistle or somethin'. (chuckles to self)

Fever's been through the roof, doc... no, wait, is that what we call it? Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up. My grandson's got one of them new-fangled thermometer thingamajigs. He said I gotta take my temperature every hour or somethin'. (mumbles to self) Never mind...

Okay, so the coughing... like I was sayin', it's awful. And this breathlessness... I mean, I'm not exactly a marathon runner anymore, but still, you'd think I'd be able to catch me breath without gettin' winded just walkin' across the room! (pauses) Speakin' of which... did I tell ya about my sister Edna? She's got a nice garden now. Tomatoes are growin' like crazy...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes... mucus. So there's lots and lots of it, but when I cough, not much comes out. It's like tryin' to get a clog unstuck with a toothpick. (laughs) Now what were we talkin' about again?"
1,Bronchial Asthma,"I've got a cough that won't go away, and I'm exhausted. I've been coughing up thick mucous and my fever is also pretty high.","I've got this cough... it won't go away, no sir. I'm so tired, doc. Can't even walk the dog without needing a nap. You know, my grandkids are always asking me to take them to the park, but I just can't keep up with 'em no more. (pauses) Oh, what was it? Ah yes, my cough. It's been going on for... um... well, let me see... three weeks now, I think? Or is that two months? Anyway, it's like a big ol' fog in my chest. Thick mucous, just pouring out of me when I cough. And this fever, doc... (chuckles) I feel like I've got the flu or something. High as a kite, I kid you not. (pauses to collect thoughts)","I'm gettin' a cough that just won't... well, you know what I mean, it just won't leave me alone! And I'm so darn tired all the time. Like I said, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but my wife was talkin' to me about her sister's cousin who had somethin' similar, and she swears by that new cough syrup with the green bottle... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the cough. It's been goin' on for weeks now, maybe even a month or so? I don't know, time sure flies when you get older!

And this mucous, it's like nothin' I've ever seen before! (chuckles) It's all thick and sticky... (pauses again) You know what reminds me of somethin'? My grandson's birthday party last year. He was playin' with that new bubble machine, and the bubbles were just floatin' everywhere... anyway... (clears throat)

Where was I? Ah yes, my cough! And this fever, it's been a bit of a nuisance too. I think it's been around 102 degrees or so... no, wait, is that normal? (looks around the room) Is your thermometer around here somewhere? Or maybe I left mine at home? (laughs nervously)

You know, I've tried some things to help myself feel better – honey and lemon, tea with ginger... but it just doesn't seem to be doin' the trick. Maybe we could try one of them new cough medicines that's all the rage these days? Or maybe... or perhaps... (trails off)"

This cough of mine just won't quit. Been havin' it for days now... or was it weeks? Shoot, I lost count... (chuckles) My wife says it's from the cold weather we had last month. Speakin' of my wife, she's still got that new kitchen gadget I bought her for Christmas... don't know what to do with it myself... anyway...

You see, doc... or whoever you are... I've been feelin' just so... tired all the time. Can't catch my breath no more. This fever, oh boy... it's like a furnace in here! (laughs) And that cough, Lord have mercy... when I do cough up somethin', it's like a whole lung comes out with it. Mucous everywhere... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, the coughin'... and now my legs feel all wobbly too... (trails off)","Oh boy, doc... (pauses) You know what I had for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with toast. Not too bad, not too bad at all. Now, let me think about this cough of mine... Yeah, it started a few weeks ago, I guess. Been feeling pretty tired, ya know? Fatigue, is that what they call it? (chuckles) My granddaughter was asking me the other day what fatigue meant, and I said ""honey, it's when you just wanna sit on the couch all day."" (laughs)

Anyway... this cough of mine. It's been bothering me something fierce. And my fever... well, I'm not exactly sure how high it is, but it feels like it's burning a hole in my chest. Breathing's getting harder too. Can't catch my breath when I walk up the stairs. (pauses to think) You know what would be nice? A nice glass of lemonade on a porch swing... (trails off)

Oh yeah, the coughing! It brings up this awful mucous. I mean, it's just... yuck. And it hurts my chest afterward. I try to take deep breaths, but it doesn't help much. (pauses again) Did I tell you about the time I went on that trip to the lake? Beautiful scenery, nice fishin'... (starts to ramble)"

(pauses) You know, I remember my cousin Edna had something similar last year... or was it the year before? (laughs) Anyway, she took some medication and got better. Now me, on the other hand... I've been runnin' a fever like nobody's business. Can't even keep track of days no more... (sighs) Oh, and this phlegm! Thick as paste, doc. It's like my body's tryin' to cough up my insides.""","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... (pauses) You see, Doc... (hesitates) Oh dear, my mind's gone blank again... (chuckles)

(trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My cough. It's been keepin' me up at night, too. Can't seem to shake it off. And this phlegm! Good grief, it's like sticky glue in my lungs. Thick as paste, I swear... (tries to remember something) You know what else was thick? The icing on the cake we had for Aunt Edna's birthday party... (distracted)

Anyway, I've got a fever that won't quit. Must be one of them viral things, right? (pauses once more) Now, where did I put my glasses?... Ah yes! My symptoms. I'd been feelin' like this for days now. Can barely get outta bed without huffin' and puffin'. Doc, you know what I think would really help me is a nice cup of tea... Earl Grey's my favorite... (wistful)"
4,Bronchial Asthma,"I feel really fatigued and weak, and I have a bad cough. My fever is really high, and my breathing has become shallow.

And this cough of mine is terrible. My sister's got one too, you know. I told her about my doctor appointment tomorrow, but she said she can't come with me, still got that cold from last month. Where was I? Ah yes, the cough. It's always there, and when I do finally get some up, it's just... sticky. Sticky, like honey or something. My breaths are all shallow too, I think that's what they call it. Shallow breathing. And my fever's been high, don't know how to describe it exactly.","I don't know if I should even bother tellin' you this, but... anyway... *pauses* Oh dear, I'm so tired all the time now. Can't seem to catch my breath no more. Like when I was a young girl, helping my mother with the chores... (chuckles) Oh, that reminds me! Did I ever tell you about our chicken coop? We had the most beautiful chickens, and they'd lay these huge eggs for Sunday breakfast...

Um, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, bein' tired. It's like someone's taken all my energy and... (stammers) Oh dear, that cough! Lord have mercy, it's killin' me! *coughs* Excuse me, sorry about that. A lot of sputum comes out when I cough. Like I said, a lot. You'd think I was drowning or somethin'... (pauses) Wait, where's my teeth powder? I could've sworn I left it on the counter...

Now, about this fever... *hesitates* Is it 103? Or is that just what I heard at bingo night? Shoot, I'm gettin' all mixed up now. You know, we used to play cards there, too... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm digressin', aren't I?

Anyway... my breathing... *struggles for words* It's like tryin' to breathe through a straw. Shallow, you said? That's it exactly! *coughs again* Sorry about this... *clears throat* Now, where was I?

And when I do cough, all this... goo comes up. Thick and stringy, like when you boil spaghetti. (pauses, looks around the room) Now, where did I put my teeth? Oh, yes! The fever, doc.

And this cough! It won't budge! Been going on for weeks now. I've tried all sorts of things: honey, lemon, even that new cough syrup from the pharmacy... (pauses) Now where did I put my reading glasses? Oh, and it's not just a cough – it's this stuff coming up. Thick and gloopy, like... like snot, but worse. (coughs again)

Fever, too. Can't remember when it started exactly... Was it last week or the week before? Time sure flies when you're having fun, don't it? (laughs) Oh dear me.

And then there's my breathing. It's all... wheezy. Like I'm trying to talk through a straw. You know that new restaurant downtown? The one with the... uh... the... (struggling to remember) Ah, you know what? Never mind! Focus, Edna! (laughs)

No, wait, is that right? It feels like longer. Anyway, my mouth's been feeling so dry, and my saliva's all thick now. You know, when I was a girl, we used to drink sarsaparilla for sore throats. My grandma would mix it with sugar... (pauses) Oh, what was the question again? Ah yes, fever. And then there's this cough... dry, scratchy. Can't seem to catch my breath.

Reminds me, I should call my sister to see if she still has her old recipe book... (trails off) 

Oh, right! The fever... it's been lingering for days now. And this cough... dry and scratchy, like sandpaper in my throat. Makes it hard to talk sometimes. My grandson, he's always saying I should try some of that new honey cough syrup his mother bought... (stops suddenly) Honey? Wasn't it... wasn't it sugar? No, no, it was honey! 

And the weakness... oh dear, I feel like I'm getting weaker by the day. Can barely walk to the kitchen without needing a break. My arthritis is acting up something fierce too... ( mutters to self) Need to remember to get more of those pain pills from my neighbor...

Fever, cough, and weakness, doctor... all these symptoms just seem to be stacking on top of each other. And I'm worried about the... uh, what's it called? Ah yes! Saliva! It's become so thick lately. Makes eating a real chore. (chuckles) Used to love my oatmeal in the mornings, but now even that seems like too much trouble...

Anyway, I just feel so poorly. And my breathing... (pauses, struggling to find the words) It's all labored and strained now. When I cough, I get this... this mucus coming up. Lots of it. Like a big ol' glob of phlegm. (chuckles) I remember when I was younger, I used to get those kind of coughs all the time. My mother always said it was just my lungs working overtime. Overtime! (laughs)

Wait, where's my reading glasses? I think I left them in... (pauses, searching for the words) ...in the kitchen somewhere. Ah yes, now I remember. It's been days since I've had a good night's sleep.

(chuckles) I swear, it's been goin' on for months now, maybe? (pauses again) Wait, what was the question? Oh right! Cough. Yeah, it's still there, won't quit. Makes me wheeze somethin' fierce when I breathe in deep... You know, reminds me of that time I went to Hawaii with my sister... No, no, not my sister... (laughs) My brother! What was his name again? (trails off) Oh dear...","I don't know what's wrong with me... (pauses) Oh dear, I had the most peculiar dream last night... I was driving my old car to the beach and...

Anyway, when I cough, there's so much mucus... like a cold or something. My mom used to have a bad cough too... (pauses, looks around the room) Where did my mom put that recipe book? Oh dear, not important now. (laughs softly)

My fever's been quite high, even at night. I'll be all right for a bit, and then suddenly I'm shivering like an old leaf. And breathing... it's hard to catch my breath sometimes. Reminds me of when your sister had that bronchitis... (pauses again) Oh dear, where did we put the sugar? We need to get some sugar...

Oh yes! My symptoms... as I was saying, they started a few weeks ago. Just feeling more tired than usual and this constant coughing. Now I'm not sure if it's just allergies or what... (trails off)"

Oh dear, coughing like crazy! It's been going on for weeks now. I think it started when I had that cold last month... or was it two months ago? No, no, don't mind me, just an old brain.

Fever's through the roof, you know. I'm pretty sure it's over a hundred. (pauses) Did we have that nice roast chicken for dinner last night? Anyway...

Sputum, they called it at the hospital that one time. Threw it away, didn't need it anymore. Now where did I put those keys? Ah yes... (clears throat) As I was saying, sputum's been quite... plentiful, lately. Can't say I'm enjoying it one bit..."

Oh yes, this cough of mine. It won't quit. Won't let up, no matter how much I hack and spit. And all that mucous... it's like my lungs are filled with glue. Coughing all day, every day. Don't know how I'm still standing. My granddaughter said I should try one of those humidifiers. What was the name of that place we went to for lunch? You know, the one with the good prime rib?

Now, about this fever... it's been through the roof. Not just a little warm, I mean sweltering. I'm talking 103, maybe higher. Can't even remember what my temperature was supposed to be when you check it. (chuckles) Ah, yes! My mother used to say that when we were kids, if you had a fever, you should drink some apple cider vinegar.

My grandson Jimmy used to say, ""Grandma's got the vapors!"" (chuckles) Lord have mercy...

It's been goin' on for weeks now, but I'm not sure if it's always been this bad or just lately. And the sputum! Thick as molasses, that's what the nurse at the clinic said. (chuckles) Molasses, Lord have mercy... anyway, it's just terrible to cough up like that.

And then there's the fever. Shoot, I think it's around a hundred and three now? Or was it one oh two? Can't keep track of all these numbers no more. (laughs) Sorry about that. Oh dear me, the exhaustion... I swear, I'm runnin' on fumes most days. Just feelin' so tired from dealin' with this cough and fever. Can't even get a decent night's sleep anymore...

Sticky stuff, like honey or somethin'. Can't remember what it's called, but it's not good, that's for sure.

Anyway, I've got this cough... (pauses) You know, my wife, God rest her soul, she used to have a similar cough before she passed away. Must be in the genes or somethin'. No, wait, that was different. She had one of them things on her chest, you know? The machine that helps with breathin'?

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, my symptoms... (clears throat) Been feelin' plumb tuckered out all the time. Can't do nothin' without gettin' winded. And this fever! Lord have mercy, it's like the flu or somethin'. Can't seem to shake it off.

(sighs) Now, let me think... where did I put that list of medications my daughter made for me? Ah yes, here it is... (rummages through papers) Uh-oh, now I'm gettin' all confused. What was the question again? Oh, right, symptoms...

Where was I? Ah yes, the sputum. Thick and sticky like that mucus stuff I mentioned before. Been coughin' it up somethin' fierce. Must be the pneumonia or... (pauses) You know what they used to call it back in my day? Phthisis! That's it. Now it's all new-fangled names, but I'm sure it's just the same old thing.

It's been goin' on for weeks now, I reckon. Fever's been through the roof, if you know what I mean. Off the charts, my grandson would say.

And the breathin', oh boy... it's like tryin' to breathe through a straw or somethin'. My chest feels all congested.

And my temperature? Shoot, it's been fluctuatin' somethin' fierce! One day I'm feelin' okay, next day I'm on fire. Off the charts, that's what my nurse said. But I don't know... I was talkin' to my friend Edna yesterday, and she swore her sister had a similar case last year... or was it two years ago? Ah, details, details...

I've been coughin' up this yucky mucus for days now. It's like nothin' I ever seen before! My doctor friend says it's all related to my sinuses, but I don't know if that's true or not... (pauses) You know what? I just remembered my wife, God rest her soul, she used to make me these lovely tea infusions for my cold. She'd mix 'em up with honey and lemon... oh boy, them were the days...

My fever's been through the roof! I swear, it's like someone's turned on a furnace in here. And this cough... oh dear Lord, it's like nothin' I've ever had before. It's like my lungs are tryin' to come outta my mouth or somethin'! (laughs) And all this phlegm... ugh, I'm gettin' tired just thinkin' about it.

You know what they say, ""you're only as old as you feel."" Well, right now I feel like I'm 100 years old! (pauses) Wait, where was I? Oh yeah, my symptoms. Like I said, I've got this terrible cough and I just can't seem to catch my breath no matter how hard I try... (gets sidetracked) Did I tell you about the time I won a prize at the county fair for growin' the biggest pumpkin?...

Weary is puttin' it mildly. I'm exhausted all the time, like someone's suckin' the energy right outta me. And don't even get me started on dealin' with all these symptoms... (sighs) It's just been a real struggle, if you know what I mean... (trails off)

You know who else had trouble breathing? My cousin Edna. She had that same thing - or was it pneumonia? I always get those two mixed up... (chuckles) Ah, well, anyway...

My cough won't go away, and it's making me short of breath. Now I'm not saying I'm out of breath like a asthmatic or anything, but... (pauses again) Oh dear, I had the most dreadful asthma attack when I was at the beach one summer... (trails off)

And this coughing up stuff... it's all thick and gooey... mucoid, is that what they call it? My niece told me about those new medicines they have now for mucoid coughs. (pauses once more) Wait, where did I put my reading glasses?

I feel just worn out, like I've been running around in the garden all day. And weak... yes, that's the word. Weak as a kitten. But you know what's not weak? My grandkids' new puppy! He's got so much energy it's a wonder he doesn't wear himself out. (chuckles)

Oh dear, I'm forgetting what we were talking about again. The cough, wasn't it? Well, that's still there, and the fever... or was it a cold? No, no... (shakes head) It's been going on for ages, I just can't seem to shake it off.

Oh yes, the cough! It's got me all worn out, exhausted, weak as a kitten.

Now, let me think back... was it last Thursday or Friday I woke up with this fever? Or was it Saturday? Doesn't matter, 'cause it's still here. And that mucous! Good gravy, it's like my body's decided to turn itself into a swamp. Can't get rid of it no matter how much water I drink.

You know what's funny? Reminds me of the time... (chuckles) Oh boy, when I used to work at the factory... no, no, not that story again! Focus, focus! The cough, yes! It's just so... persistent. I'll be in bed, lying there, and suddenly I'm gasping for air like a fish out of water. And then there are these... these wheezing sounds. Sounds like my old car, the one with the... (laughs) never mind.

High fever, that's what you called it? Yes, yes, that's what the young doc at the clinic said too. Weaker than a lamb, I swear. Just can't seem to shake this... this whatever-it-is off me. Can we try something for it now, please?"

(pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! Breathing. It's just that I get winded so easily now. Like when I'm walking to the kitchen for a glass of water... (laughs)

Mucus, yes! Too much of it. Always getting coughed up or dripped down the back of my throat. Ugh! It's just... (sighs) And on top of all that, I'm so tired. Can't seem to get any energy no matter how much rest I take. Just feels like... you know, being an old person, I guess. (laughs softly)

And you know what? It's not just a little one neither. No sir, it's more like... well, it's hard to explain. Like tryin' to get air through a straw. (pauses) Oh, I remember now! My cousin Edna had that problem too. She said it was allergies or somethin'. I always thought it was the pollen count in this town, but maybe she just didn't like... uh, dustin'? No, no, I'm gettin' ahead of myself.

Anyway, the cough's been goin' on for weeks now. And then there's my fever. It comes and goes, you know? Like a cold shower or somethin'. I mean, not that I've taken one in ages... (chuckles) My knees don't like the idea of gettin' up from the tub anymore.

Mucus, oh boy! I swear it's everywhere. In my chest, on my pillow, even in my coffee cup this mornin'... (laughs) Don't know how that happened. Must've coughed while pourin'? Yeah, that's probably it.

And weakness? Shoot, I'm weaker than a kitten. Can barely get outta bed some mornings. Can't remember when last time was I had an appetite like that. Food tastes funny too. Maybe it's just my stomach actin' up again... (pauses) Wait, I think I took one of them probiotics, didn't I?"

Now, I know you're thinkin', ""What else is new?"" But let me tell you, Doctor... *pauses* Ah yes! My cough! It's just terrible. I've been coughin' and coughin', like my old cat, Mittens, used to do when she had that... uh... what was it? (laughs) Oh dear, never mind. This cough is persistent, you see. Persistent, persistent!

And then there's the shortness of breath... *pauses* Now where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes! Shortness of breath. It's like when I'm tryin' to climb those stairs at home, you know, up to the attic? (laughs) Oh dear, not the attic... but, anyway...

Now, about this mucoid saliva... *ahem* Thick, sticky stuff comin' outta my mouth all day and night. Just like when I used to eat too much sugar as a young girl! You know, my mother always said... (trails off) Oh dear, what was it she said? Ah yes! ""Eat your vegetables!"" (laughs)

Now, the weariness... *coughs* Excuse me, Doctor. It's just that I feel like I'm runnin' on empty all the time. Like when I used to be at the beach and watchin' them big ol' ships sail by? You know, back in '45? (laughs) Oh dear...

Oh, and one more thing... *pauses* The fatigue! It's just so... exhausting. Just like when... uh... what was that time... you know, when I went to... (sighs) Never mind, Doctor..."

Now, where was I? Ah yes! The exhaustion. I'm plumb tuckered out. Can't do a thing without gettin' winded or breakin' into this cough again. (coughs) Excuse me, please... I just got the most dreadful thought: I think I left my keys in the fridge... no, wait... in the car? No, that's not it neither... (laughs)

Oh dearie me! You know what they say about too much worryin'? It'll give you a cough like this one. Must be all these worries keepin' me up at night... my wife, she says I'm too hard on myself..."
46,Bronchial Asthma,"Hello, Mom and Father Recently, I've felt incredibly worn out and have had a cough that won't go away. My fever is really high, and my breathing has become shallow. Additionally, I've been coughing up a lot of mucous, thick sputum.","""Hello, Doctor... I think. Or is it nurse? Anyway, been feeling just exhausted lately. Can't even do my daily walk without getting winded. And this cough! It won't quit. Been going on for weeks now, maybe months? I'm not sure. Time gets away from me. You know, remind me to ask my grandson about that new recipe he sent over... anyway...

""I've been feeling feverish, got a temperature probably over 102 degrees Fahrenheit. And when I breathe in, it's like my chest is caving in. Shallow breathing, they call it? Is that right, Doctor? Always worrying 'bout something or other. My sister Edna was saying the other day... but anyway...

""This coughing up mucus business, though... it's thick and gloopy, not like when I'm sick with a cold. This is different. Thick sputum, they say. Got a picture in my mind of sputum now... must be from that health class... what was the teacher's name?""","Oh dearie me... I think it's been a week now? Or is it two weeks? Hmm, my memory isn't what it used to be... Anyway, I've just felt so... so tired all the time. Can't seem to get out of bed in the morning without feeling like I've run a marathon. And this cough! (coughs) Ah, pardon me... It's been going on for ages, doc... Ages! I swear, it started after that lovely dinner with the family last month... Or was it two months? Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up... My wife, God rest her soul... She used to make such wonderful chicken soup. (pauses) Ah yes, my fever! It's been through the roof, if you know what I mean... 102, I'm pretty sure of it... (mumbles to self) Now where did I put that thermometer? Always losing things around here...

And this breathing business... (panting) Oh dear, it's like my lungs are working overtime or something. Can't catch a full breath no matter what I do. And the coughing up... well, let me tell you, doc... It's like a faucet that just won't turn off! Thick sputum, I'm quite sure of it. Just like when my grandson was sick last winter... (trails off) Now what was his name again? Ah yes, Jimmy! Poor little fella had the same cough for weeks on end... My goodness gracious, I do hope this isn't something serious... (gulps)"
47,Bronchial Asthma,"I've been struggling with fatigue and a constant cough that's been making it difficult to breathe. My fever is high, and I've been coughing up a lot of thick, mucoid sputum.","I've been feeling so...exhausted lately. Fatigue, you know? And this cough, oh boy...it just won't quit. It's like my chest is trying to expel a bag of flour or something. (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I was at the bakery and they had those big ol' sacks of flour everywhere... (trails off)

Oh, yes! My breathing. It's getting harder and harder to catch my breath. (pauses) Fever, I think? Yeah, it's been high for...um...I don't know how long now. Days? Weeks? (shrugs) And the sputum...good heavens, it's like something from a bad cold. Thick and mucoid...just yuck! Can't even swallow my meds without coughing some more. I swear, I've been going through boxes of tissues...","I'm so sorry, doc... I've been feelin' just terrible lately. Fatigue, you know? Can't even get outta bed in the mornin'. And this cough, Lord have mercy... it's like nothin' I've ever had before. It's constant, day and night. Makes me want to cry, it hurts so bad.

Now, what was I talkin' about? Ah yes, the breathin'. It's hard, doc. Real hard. Like my lungs are stuck in a vice or somethin'. And this fever... shoot, I don't know how high it is, but I'm sure it's too high. I've been takin' them pills you gave me, but they don't seem to be workin'.

Mucoid sputum? Is that what it's called? Yeah, that's right. Thick and sticky... like honey or somethin'. I cough up big ol' globs of it all day long. It's disgusting, doc. Just awful.

You know, my grandma used to have trouble with her breathin', too. She'd get these spells where she couldn't catch her wind at all. Poor thing. I remember... uh... no, wait, that wasn't right. Oh dear, I'm gettin' ahead of myself. Where was I? Ah yes, the cough.

So, it's been like this for weeks now... maybe longer. Time kinda blurs together when you're feelin' this bad. But I know it's been a while since I last felt like myself. And that's when I started noticin' these problems. Maybe earlier than that, but... uh... anyway.

Now, can you please tell me what I'm supposed to be takin'? Those pills? The ones with the pretty paper wrapper? Yeah, those. How many of 'em am I s'posed to take a day?"
48,Bronchial Asthma,"Doctor Due to a high fever, I haven't been able to breathe via my nose or mouth for a few days and feeling too tired.sometimes mucus has been seen too.Please recommend some medications for me.","Oh dear doc... I've had this fever, you see... high temperature, must have been for days now, but I'm not sure how many. Time just flies by when you're feeling like this. Anyway, breathing's become a problem. No air in my nose or mouth, it's all clogged up. Mucus, y'know? Sometimes I wake up and there's a big glob in the back of my throat... can't swallow it down either. Makes me feel all stuck up, if you know what I mean. Don't know how I'm supposed to breathe like this... (pauses) Now, where did I put that recipe for chicken soup?","(speaking slowly with a hint of difficulty articulating) Oh dear, doctor... I'm afraid I've been feeling quite poorly lately... (pauses) You know, I was just thinking about my sister Edna, she had a high fever too, back in '52... or was it 53? (chuckles) Ah, yes, anyway...

I woke up one morning and I just felt so tired, like I'd been running around all day. And then this nasty cough started, oh dear... (coughs slightly) Excuse me... Oh, where was I? Ah yes, the cough! It's been bothering me for days now. Can't breathe through my nose or mouth, you see... (pauses to collect thoughts)

Sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I feel like there's all this mucus just stuck inside me, y'know? And then it starts dripping down my throat... Ugh! (shudders) But, oh dear, I'm getting on with it... Anyway...

High fever, you see. Can't remember when it started exactly... (pauses) Was it three days ago? Four? Oh dear, time's gotten away from me! (laughs weakly) Must be due to all these medicines they put me on last year for my arthritis... (trails off)

Mucus, yes! Sometimes I see it in the morning. Looks like... well, like something you'd scrape off a shoe, if you know what I mean! (chuckles nervously) Oh dear...

I'm so tired all the time now... Can't even remember when was the last time I took a proper nap. (pauses) Oh, doctor, could we get some of those pills for me? You know, to clear out this mucus and whatnot? Would you be able to prescribe something?"
49,Bronchial Asthma,"I've had ongoing health problems for a week, including a dry cough, breathing difficulties, and general weakness.","You know, doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' poorly for a week now, maybe longer? (chuckles) Time flies when you're not havin' fun, don't it? My granddaughter's birthday was last weekend, and I made her favorite cake... strawberry shortcake. (pauses again) Oh, right, my symptoms! (clears throat)

I've got this dry cough, like someone's ticklin' the back of my throat with a feather duster. And gettin' winded just walkin' to the mailbox? That's not normal for me. I used to be able to mow the lawn without breakin' a sweat... (trails off) Wait, was it last Tuesday or Wednesday when this started?

Anyway, I'm feelin' weak, like I need to take a nap just thinkin' about gettin' out of bed. And them breathing difficulties? (pauses, takes a deep breath) Excuse me... I mean, they're gettin' worse at night, makin' it hard for me to sleep.","I don't know what's goin' on with me lately... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my tea? Ah yes... anyway... So, I've been feelin' just terrible for a week now. Got this cough that won't quit, dry as the Sahara desert it is. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time we went on vacation to Arizona... such lovely memories.

But, back to this cough... it's been keepin' me up at night, and I wake up feelin' just... (pauses, searching for words) ...drained. Yes, that's the word. Drained. Like all my energy's gone with the wind. (mumbles to herself) Now where did I put my reading glasses?

As I was sayin', this cough is gettin' me down somethin' awful. And then there's these breathing difficulties... (taps chest) like someone's got their hand wrapped around my ribcage, makin' it hard to breathe. My goodness gracious, what's the name of that song? The one with the lungs in it... you know, ""The Lungs Song""? (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old...

And weakness... oh boy, I feel like a wet noodle. Just can't seem to muster up the strength for nothin'. (pauses, looking around the room) Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes... so that's been my problem for about a week now. I hope you can help me figure out what's goin' on... or is it two weeks? I always get those things mixed up..."
50,Hypertension,"I have been experiencing a headache, chest pain, dizziness, and difficulty maintaining my balance. I also feel like I am having trouble concentrating","Doc... I'm not sure how long this has been going on... (pauses) You know, just like that one time I was visiting my sister in Florida and we went to the beach? Beautiful sunset... anyway...

Headaches, yeah, got those. And chest pains. Like a squeezing or pressure feeling. Not sharp pain, but more of a dull ache. Can't quite put my finger on it. (pauses) Wasn't it last Tuesday I had that big ol' turkey dinner? My granddaughter, Emily... no, not Emily, it was Sarah who helped me cook...

Oh, and dizziness. Like standing up from the couch or something. Room spins a bit. Can be quite disorienting. (hesitates) Now, let's see... where did I put that list of my medications? Ah yes, here it is. (chuckles)

And balance, well... it's like trying to walk on slippery ice without skates. Can't seem to catch myself. Feel a bit... lightheaded, I suppose. Not sure how long this has been going on... might've started after that incident with the ladder last month? Or was it before that? (laughs) Oh dear...

Anyway, concentrating's not easy for me either. Words get all jumbled up in my head like a big ol' mess. Frustrating business...","I'm not sure how long this been goin' on... seems like a week or two now... headaches, ya know? Just regular ol' headaches, but lately they've been gettin' worse. More frequent, I reckon. Like every day or so. And then there's the chest pain. Now, that's new. Don't remember ever havin' nothin' like that before. Can't say what it feels like exactly... hurt? No, not really hurt... more like... tightness, I guess. Yeah, that's it.

And then there's this dizziness business. Walks up and down the hallway, but can't seem to keep my balance right. Like a kid learnin' to ride a bike all over again. (chuckles) Get the shakes somethin' fierce when I try to get outta bed in the mornin'. Don't know what's causin' it... might be them new shoes, I don't know...

Trouble concentratin', too. Now that's the worrisome part. Just can't seem to focus on nothin' for more than five minutes without my mind startin' to wander off in a different direction. Like I'm tryin' to watch TV and suddenly remember I gotta pick up some milk at the store... (pauses) Oh, I think it was last Wednesday when we went to see our grandkids play little league. Now that's somethin' I don't forget no more than I forgot what I had for breakfast this mornin'."
51,Hypertension,"Along with a headache, chest pain, instability, and balance issues, I've also been feeling dizzy. I also think I'm having problems focusing.","I don't know if it's my age catchin' up with me or what, but I've been feelin' pretty lousy lately... (pauses) You know, I was tryin' to fix that leaky faucet in the kitchen yesterday, and I swear, I've fixed it before, but... anyway... Along with this headache I got, I'm gettin' chest pain. It's more of a tightness, like someone's squeezin' my heart. (pauses again) My granddaughter, Emily, she came over for dinner last night, and we had the most wonderful time... Ah, yes! So, besides that, I've been feelin' pretty unstable on my feet. I mean, I trip over my own feet sometimes. And dizziness, oh boy, it's like swimmin' in a pool without knowin' how to swim. (chuckles) My husband always says I'm prone to gettin' lost... anyway... I also think I might be havin' some trouble focusin', can't seem to sit still for more than five minutes.","I don't know if it's just me... been feelin' kinda off lately... (pauses) You know what I was thinkin' about? My sister's birthday party... we had a big ol' cake, and I remember wearin' that new dress... anyway... (clears throat)

This headache, doc... it's been goin' on for days. And the chest pain... now that's somethin' new. Don't know if it's related to my arthritis or what. (mutters to self) Need to get those X-rays done...

Now, I'm not exactly sure how to explain this... but I've been feelin' kinda... unstable, I guess you'd say. Like when you're on a boat and the waves are rockin' it back and forth. That's what it feels like in my knees. And my balance? Shoot, I'm gettin' all turned around just standin' up from sittin'. (chuckles) You know how that is...

And dizzy... yeah. Dizzy's a big one. Can't focus on nothin', can't even watch TV without gettin' all lightheaded... like when you're readin' a book and the words start to blur together. That's what it feels like in my head.

Now, I think this might be important... or maybe not. We had these wonderful biscuits at church last week, and I remember thinkin' about makin' some for Sunday dinner... (trails off) Oh, right! My symptoms! Yeah, I've been feelin' dizzy, too... like my whole body's wobbly...

That's it, I reckon... unless... unless there's something else. Hmm? What was it? Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now..."

I also think I'm having problems focusing.","""Doc, oh dear, I've been feelin' just terrible lately. My head hurts somethin' fierce, like a knife stabbin' in. And then there's this chest pain... you know, like when I was workin' at the factory and that time I got stuck in the pipe? (chuckles) Ah, anyway... it's been on my left side, steady as clockwork.

""I'm havin' trouble walkin', too. My balance is all off. Just yesterday, I was gettin' a glass of water from the kitchen, and whoa! I thought I was gonna fall over for sure. And my focus... well, it's like tryin' to recall where I put my teeth. Um, that's not right, dear. Focus... hmm... (pauses) Oh, yes! Can't concentrate on nothin' for more than five seconds.

""And feelin' unwell? That's just a nice way of sayin' I'm miserable. My wife says it's probably just my age catchin' up with me, but I swear, Doc, somethin' ain't right.""","I don't know if it's just me, but I've been feelin'... not right, ya see? And this one thing that's been botherin' me is my head hurts somethin' fierce. Can't quite put my finger on where, though. Sometimes it's in the front, sometimes it's at the back of my neck. (pauses) Oh, wait! I remember now, I was talkin' to Edna at the senior center last week, and she said her granddaughter's got a headache too... same as me! Must be somethin' contagious, I suppose.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my head. So it hurts, but that's not all, no sirree. Now, about this chest pain... (hesitates) It started last night, right after supper. Chicken parmesan, you know, with the ziti and the garlic bread. My son Jimmy made it for me; he's a good boy, even if he does like that new-fangled music. Anyway, I digress.

This chest pain... feels like someone took hold of my heart and squeezed it tight. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I went to the picture show? Saw ""Casablanca"" with Ingrid Bergman... such a tragic love story. But back to this chest pain... makes me feel all fluttery inside.

Now, what else was it I wanted to say? Ah yes! I've been feelin' unstable, like a leaf blowin' in the wind. My balance is off, and I keep thinkin', ""What's goin' on here?"" You know how sometimes you're just gettin' along just fine, and then suddenly... (shrugs) I'm not quite myself, if you catch my drift.

Oh, and this focus thingy... can't seem to concentrate like I used to. Try to read a book, but the words just sorta... slide right off my mind, like water on a stone."

(pauses) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up. Head pain, yes, like a dull ache, you know? But then there's this other thing – chest pain, I'm pretty sure it's been going on for weeks now. Though I could've sworn Doc Johnson said something about it being stress-related... (chuckles) Oh, and don't get me started on my balance! I feel like a ship in the middle of the ocean one minute, then suddenly I'm fine the next.

I think I wrote down some of this stuff in that notebook... (rummages through papers) Ah, yes! Here it is. I said something about instability too. (pauses) And then there's my head – I just can't seem to focus on anything for more than a minute or two. Just like trying to read the newspaper, but all the words start running together...","I'm afraid I've been feelin' rather... under the weather, if you know what I mean. Head pain, yes, that's been there for a few days now. And then this chest... thing... hurts when I breathe in or out, I think it's both. Can't rightly remember which. (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh, and my joints, they creak somethin' fierce. Don't know if it's the weather changin', but I'm gettin' a bit of... (hesitates) instability, is that what you call it? Feel like I'm standin' on shaky ground.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, my head. Throbbin' somethin' awful. And focusin'? Forget about it! Can't keep track of nothin'. Reminds me of when I had to learn how to use them new-fangled typewriters in school... (trails off) What were we talkin' about again? Oh yes, my symptoms.

I've been feelin' a bit... lightheaded. Don't know if it's just the heat or whatnot. My wife says I've been gettin' more and more forgetful lately. Now, that's not like me at all! (chuckles) I remember when we first got married, my dear would always say... (catches self) Ah yes, focus.

I think that's it, though. Head pain, chest pain, instability... balance issues, is that the right word? And this... um... difficulty with focusin'. That's all I can think of at the moment, anyway. (pauses, lost in thought)

Oh dear, sorry about that...

Anyway, this headache... it's been here for a while now. Can't quite pinpoint when it started, but it feels like a tight band around my forehead. And chest pain... (pauses) I think it's when I walk up the stairs? No, wait, is that a hip issue we talked about last time? (chuckles) Ah dear, mind goes blank sometimes...

Dizziness too, when I'm standin' up or gettin' outta bed. Like my world just tilts sideways... You know what I did yesterday morning? Went to the store for some more of that almond milk. Can't remember why I wanted it now. (laughs nervously) Oh dear, and concentrate? (pauses) Focusing on things is harder than ever these days...","I don't know if I'm doin' this right...

Headache... yes, my head's been achin' somethin' fierce. Can't even remember what day it is most days. (laughs nervously)

And then there's this chest pain. I'm gettin' a little worried about that one. It feels like someone's got their hand around my heart and squeezin'. You know how sometimes you have those funny dreams where your heart feels heavy? Like, it's tryin' to tell me somethin'? (pauses)

Now, dizziness... I've been gettin' dizzy spells like crazy! Walk into a room and wham! Everything starts spinning. Just hope I don't pass out in front of my book club. (giggles) We were readin' that new Harlequin romance last week...

And my chest, dear Lord... pains me somethin' fierce. Feels like someone's squeezin' it tight. Dizziness, too... feels like the room's spinnin'. My daughter says I've been a bit of a mess lately, (laughs) can't even remember where I put my keys! And focusin'? Forget about it! Try to watch TV, but all I see is a jumble.

(taps forehead) Shoot, what was I doin' before this headache started? We were at the park... or was it the store? (laughs nervously)

Oh dear, and my chest. It's been actin' up too. ( Places hand on chest) This dull achin' feelin', like someone's got a vise on me. (pauses, lost in thought) Now where did I put my glasses...? Ah yes! Focusin' troubles. Can't seem to concentrate no more. Try to remember what day it is... or what my name is for that matter! (giggles)

Dizziness, you say? Well, I've been feelin' like I'm sailin' on a boat. Rocks and waves all around me. Got to hold onto the armrest there for support... just in case. (fidgets) And then them symptoms started stackin' up like cards. Chest pain, dizziness, headaches... it's a regular circus in here! (laughs weakly)

Say, you know who else had these problems? My Aunt Edna. She swore by them herbal teas. ""Drink this and you'll be right as rain!"" (guffaws) I think she must've been drinkin' it all the wrong way... or maybe I just didn't listen close enough..."

(chuckles) Oh dear, where was I?

And then there's this dizziness. Lord have mercy, it's like my whole world is spinning! (laughs nervously) I mean, I've been dizzy before, but this is somethin' else. Trouble balancin' myself too. Went to the grocery store yesterday and almost fell over from standin' in front of the bread aisle... or was it the cereal? (pauses) Hmm...

And my mind, it's all foggy. Can't focus no more. Try to watch TV, but my eyes glaze right over. Don't know what's goin' on half the time. (laughs again) Just like that one time I tried to cook dinner and set the kitchen curtains on fire! (chuckles)

You see, doc said somethin' about me needin'... (pauses) What was it? Oh yes, a checkup! He said this would help figure out what's wrong. Now, where did I put my walker? Ah, there it is. (pats walker reassuringly)

Anyway... this dizziness. It felt like I was on one of them boat rides they take you on at the lake. You know, where it spins around and makes your stomach drop? (nervously chuckles) Not a nice feelin', let me tell you.

And balance, dear me! I tripped over my own feet comin' into this office today... or was it yesterday? (laughs) I always get those days mixed up. You know what they say: as we age... (sighs)

And then there's this... what do you call it... chest pain? Oh yes, my doctor told me about that. You know, it's like when I'm watching TV and someone's having a heart attack on the screen, but I've never had one myself. Although... although I did have that funny feeling last week... I think it was after I ate that nice roast beef dinner. My stomach was all upset, if you recall.

But now, let me see... dizziness. That's right! It's when you're standing and your head starts spinning around like those old merry-go-rounds we used to go on at the fairground. Oh dearie me, I do get dizzy sometimes, especially in stores with all them lights and whatnot.

Losing my balance? Well, I wouldn't say that exactly... but I did trip over my cat last week. Yes, that's it! My cat, Whiskers. She's a bit of a handful, but I love her dearly.

(sighs) Well, I'm gettin' all mixed up now, aren't I?

Anyway, I thought maybe we could... (pauses once more) You know what? Never mind, I'll start again. My concentration's been shot to pieces, and I don't feel like myself no more. It's quite distressin', if you ask me."

I remember we went to the park yesterday, and I saw those lovely birds again, just flittin' about in the trees... anyway... where was I? Ah yes, this headache. It won't budge, not even with them newfangled pain relievers. And I've been feelin' dizzy, too - like my feet's stuck to the floor or somethin'. Unsteady, that's the word.

Can't hardly catch my breath sometimes. And that headache... well, it's just been a constant companion, like that pesky aunt of mine who always seemed to find fault in everything we did when I was growin' up (laughs). Now where's my tea? I swear, I had it right here on the table...

Oh yes! My dizziness. I get these spells where I feel like I'm stuck in a boat on choppy waters... (gulps) You know what I mean? Unsteady, like I might just tumble over at any minute. Not to mention my knees ache somethin' terrible when I get up from the chair. Now what was it you were sayin', doctor? Ah yes! My symptoms. Well, like I said, my chest... aches.

Time sure flies when you're havin' fun, but not like this... no sirree.

I did have a lovely trip to visit my sister in Florida last year... We went to the beach and had some wonderful fish 'n' chips at that quaint little café near her house... (pauses again) Where was I?

And then there's this headache... (pauses) Oh, what was it they called that new medication for high blood pressure? That Mr. Johnson's wife had to take? Anyway, it doesn't help with my head. I've been feeling so off-balance lately, like I'm walking on ice skates or something. Dizzy and unsteady, you know?

And then there's this head pain. I've been getting it for weeks now, but no one seems to know what's causing it. I told my sister, she said I should see a doctor, like we're kids again... (chuckles) Oh dear, sorry about that.

Dizzy and unsteady? That's how I feel! Like when I used to get on those new-fangled bicycles with the training wheels... (pauses, lost in thought) I remember riding up to the ice cream parlor, it was a special treat... Where was I?

Oh right! The dizziness. It's not just me, my friend Edna has been getting that too, she thinks it's her blood pressure... but I'm not so sure. (pauses again)

Now let me think about when this all started... (rummages through memories) Hmm... could've been after the storm last month? Or maybe it was before that? Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up! What was I saying?

Ah yes, the chest pain. Then came the dizziness and now this headache... feels like I've been hit by a truck. (chuckles) Not literally, of course... but it does feel that way.

Now let me think about this... I'm sure there's somethin' else... (pauses) Oh dear, my wife's sister had something like this once... or was it my niece? Wait, no... (trails off)

So, like I said, the chest pain and dizziness are bad. And that headache around my head... you see what I mean? It's not just one spot... more like a circle or something. You know how some people have those headaches when they get older? That's this. (hesitates) But it's worse.

And dizziness too... *hesitates* Not like when I get up from the couch and everything spins around. No sir, this is different.

Ah yes, balance issues.

And then there's this dizziness... (pauses, squints eyes) Like when you're on a boat, and it's rockin' back and forth... (trails off) My cousin Edna used to love those big ol' cruise ships.

Balance, too... it's like my body's playin' tricks on me. One minute I'm walkin', next I'm stumblin' over nothin'. My grandkids say I'm gettin' a little too steady with the canes now, but... well, they don't understand. (pauses again) We had a nice visit from them just last Sunday...

Wait, no, I had lunch first... anyway, it's been a bit off all day.

Now, let me think... what was it? Oh yes, the dizzy spells! Been feeling like I'm going to stumble over my own feet all morning. Must've gotten up too quickly from bed or something. Always do that, but this time it feels different. Like my balance is all wonky... (pauses) Speaking of which, did I tell you about the time I fell at the park? Broke my hip, poor me! Ah, anyway... the dizziness's been getting worse as the day goes on, and now I'm feeling a bit unsteady on my feet.","I woke up this morning... or was it yesterday? No, no, it was today, I'm sure of it. Anyway, I woke up with a headache, just a regular ol' headache, you know? Not too bad, not too good. Just... there. And then I noticed my chest hurtin'. Now, I don't remember what the doctor said about that last time, but I think he said something about... (pauses) Ah yes, my blood pressure! Is it high again? I always forget.

Now, this morning, when I got up to make some coffee – and let me tell you, I love my coffee – I felt a bit... lightheaded. You know how it is. Dizzy, unsteady on your feet... (pauses) Did I take my pills? I think so. No, wait, maybe not. Don't worry about that now. As I was sayin', the dizziness got worse throughout the day. I had to hold onto the counter in the kitchen just to make sure I didn't fall over. Not a pretty sight, I'm afraid.

Now, let me think... (pauses) Where's my reading glasses? Ah yes, on my head! Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, the pain. It's just below my... what do they call it... sternum? Is that right? And it hurts a bit when I breathe in deep. But only a bit. Not too bad. Just... (pauses) Oh dear, I just remembered I need to pick up some milk on the way home from here!"
84,Hypertension,"I had a headache and chest pain this morning, and as the day wore on, I also started to feel unsteady and unstable on my feet.","Now, where was I? Ah yes... this morning... well, I woke up with one of them headaches, you know, the kind that makes your whole head feel like it's been squished in a vise. And then, just like my aunt Edna always said, ""when it rains, it pours."" And by golly, I started gettin' this chest pain too! Sharp as a tack, right between the shoulder blades... or was it the other day? Anyway, it's been botherin' me all morning. Now, you see, my feet... (pauses) Oh dearie me, what's that song I used to love singin'? Ah yes, ""When the Saints Go Marching In""... anyway... unsteady on my feet, like a newborn giraffe! And now, I'm not sure if it's been three days or four since this all started. (chuckles) Now where did I put those reading glasses?","I'm gettin' a might... uh, you know, a headache this mornin'. Yeah, it was one of them headaches. Can't quite put my finger on what caused it, but I thought maybe it was from eatin' too much cheese yesterday. I mean, I love cheese, don't get me wrong, but sometimes it seems to... settle in the back of my head.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, headache. And then this... this chest pain started up. Now I'm not one for gettin' worked up over a little chest pain, but this felt different. It was like... (pauses) Oh, I remember! My cousin Edna had the same thing, and it turned out she had to have her gallbladder taken out.

But I digress. As I was sayin', my feet started feelin' all wobbly. Unsteady, that's the word. Like when you're gettin' up from a chair after bein' seated for too long. You know what I mean? (chuckles) I hope so, anyway... And then there were these dizziness spells, like my world was spinnin' around me. Now I'm not sure if it's related to the headache or the chest pain, but...

(clears throat) Oh, and one more thing! My arm keeps fallin' asleep on me. Not that it hurts or anything, just feels... numb-like. Hmmph. Could be from sittin' at this confounded desk of mine too long, I reckon. (mutters to self) Now where did I put my... uh...

Anyway, as you can see, I'm a bit... perplexed myself. Just don't know what's goin' on with me today. All these symptoms... Can't recall the last time I felt so... off-balance."
85,Hypertension,"I have been dealing with a headache and chest pain for a few days now, but today the dizziness and loss of balance became much worse.","Oh dear, doc... I've been having this headache and chest pain for... um... let me see... *pauses*... a few days now, I think? Or is it longer than that? Time sure flies when you're old... anyway... my head's been achin' somethin' fierce. And the chest pains, they've been there too. *mumbles to self* Need to remember to pick up some of them new-fangled pain relievers at the pharmacy...

But today, oh dear Lord have mercy, I'm gettin' this dizziness and loss of balance... *pauses again*... it's like my feet are stuck to the floor or somethin'! Can't even walk straight no more. And it's worse than ever before... *tries to remember a relative with similar symptoms*... wasn't it your sister, Edna? Or was it Emily? Anyway, she had something like this... Ah, never mind that now...

Oh dear me, I'm gettin' all mixed up...","I don't know if I'm gettin' old or what... (pauses) My head's been achin', like a big ol' hammer just poundin' away in there. And my chest, it hurts too... (trails off) Wait, where was I? Oh yeah, the headache. It's been goin' on for days now. I thought maybe it was just from liftin' them heavy bags of groceries or somethin'. But today... (pauses again) Today, I was walkin' to the kitchen and suddenly I felt like I was floatin' away! (chuckles nervously) Like my feet were stuck to the floor but my head was up in the air. Made me think of that time we went to the lake house... remember that? We had a big ol' storm come through and our little sailboat tipped over. But I digress... (clears throat)

Dizziness, loss of balance, like I said. It's real bad today. Can't even walk straight no more. And my heart's been racin', too. Feel it just poundin' away in here. (places hand on chest) Like a drumbeat. Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""What about your blood pressure?"" (pauses for comedic effect) Well, I had it checked last month and... uh... (fumbles with memory) Oh dear me, can't quite recall the number... (sighs) Anyway..."
86,Hypertension,"For a few days now, I've been suffering from a headache and chest pain, but today the dizziness and lack of balance got considerably worse.","Doc, I'm tellin' ya... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my head. It's been achin' for a few days now. And this chest pain, it's been naggin' me too. Can't say when exactly it started, but I think it was... uh... last Thursday? No, no, that can't be right. My son's birthday was last week, wasn't it? (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway...

Today, though, it's gotten a lot worse. This dizziness and lack of balance business... (pauses to collect thoughts) You know, I tried to walk to the mailbox this morning and almost fell over! Almost lost my footing, I did. (laughs nervously) My wife said I was gettin' too close to the flowers again, but it's not that, I'm sure of it. It's just... (hesitates) ...this other thing. Headache and chest pain, dizziness... and now I'm feelin' a bit light-headed, if you know what I mean. (trails off)","I'm gettin' all these aches and pains, doc... or is it nurse? I always get 'em mixed up nowadays. Anyway, this headache of mine, it's been goin' on for a few days now. I think it started Wednesday? No, wait, was that Tuesday? Oh dear, my mind gets all jumbled sometimes...

You see, what happened Wednesday was... (pauses) I went to the store, and I bought some milk, but when I got home, I realized I left the stove on! I swear, I told myself a million times not to do that. Now, where was I? Ah yes, this headache... It's like a big ol' band around my head, squeezin' tighter every hour. I've been takin' some of those pain pills, but they don't seem to be helpin' much.

Now, about this chest pain... (pauses again) I think it's related to the heart? No, no, not that. It's like... have you ever seen one of those big ol' trucks drive by with its trailer attached? That's what my chest feels like – all wobbly and stuff.

And today, oh boy... (chuckles) Today's been a doozy. This dizziness got me, and I couldn't even walk to the kitchen without holdin' onto somethin'. My balance, it's all off. Like when you're on one of them amusement park rides – ya know, the spinning teacups? Yeah, like that.

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes... (laughs) Now where did I put my tea?"
87,Hypertension,"I was at work when I started feeling a headache, chest pain, and dizziness. It's been hard for me to concentrate and focus on my tasks since then.","Oh boy, I was at work yesterday... or was it Tuesday? Anyway, it started with this headache, right here in my forehead. I remember thinkin', ""What's goin' on?"" Then I got this chest pain, and it was like a tightness, you know? And dizziness too, oh my goodness. Made it hard to focus, couldn't even get my paperwork done. My boss said somethin' about a deadline... (pauses) What day is today, anyway?

You see, I was makin' copies for the Johnson account... or was it Smith? Ah yes! Johnson. Anyway, this all started after lunch, I think. Had a nice sandwich at Denny's with my friend Edna. She said she saw me last week, but I could've sworn... (chuckles) Oh dear, now I'm gettin' all mixed up.

Back to the pain, it was there for hours, on and off. Sometimes it felt like a band around my chest, other times it just throbbed. And this dizziness, it's still with me, makes me feel like I'm about to... (pauses) You know what I mean? Can't even remember the word... Ah yes! Faint!","I was at work... you know, I think it was yesterday? No, wait, maybe it was last week? Hmm, I'm gettin' all mixed up now... anyway, I was at work and I started feelin' this headache, right between my eyes. It was like a big ol' knot. And then I felt this pain in my chest... not too bad at first, but then it got worse. I thought maybe I'd eaten somethin' wrong for lunch.

You know what's funny? Yesterday, I was makin' myself a sandwich and I realized I don't even like turkey anymore! What happened to me, eh? Used to love that stuff... (pauses) Oh yeah, the headache and chest pain. Like I said, it started yesterday... or maybe last week... I'm gettin' old, Doc, my memory ain't what it used to be.

Now, where was I? Ah yes! Dizziness! That's a new one for me. Feel like I'm on a boat, you know? All wobbly and no land in sight. It's hard to focus... can't even remember how many tasks we had due at the office today. (chuckles) Maybe that's just because I'm gettin' old! Or maybe it's the coffee... don't drink too much of it, Doc. (giggles)

Anyway... like I was sayin', dizziness and all this other stuff. Can't even concentrate on nothin'. My boss said somethin' about a project deadline? What deadline? (trails off) Oh dearie me..."
88,Hypertension,"When I first experienced a headache, chest pain, and lightheadedness, I was at work. Since then, it has been challenging for me to focus and concentrate on my work.","You know, doc... (chuckles) I was at the office, tryin' to get some work done, and suddenly I got this headache, right? It was like a knife in my head, throbbin' somethin' awful. And then I felt this chest pain, too. I mean, it wasn't just my heart, if you know what I mean... (pauses) My cousin Edna's brother-in-law had something similar, but that was years ago... anyway...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the lightheadedness. It was like I was gonna pass out or somethin'. I had to grab onto my desk for support. Since then... (pauses again) Wait, what day is it today? Tuesday, right? (chuckles) No, no, that's not important...

Since then, gettin' up in the mornin' has been a struggle. My mind just isn't where it used to be. I mean, I'll be sittin' there tryin' to focus on my work, but... (pauses once more) I swear, I could've sworn I saw our receptionist, Karen... no, not Karen, I think it was Laura... anyway... Can't seem to concentrate for more than a few minutes. Sorry about that, doc.","I don't know if it's just me gettin' older... or maybe it's these new meds I'm takin', but anyway... (pauses) Oh dear, I was talkin' to my sister-in-law the other day, and she said... (trails off)

Oh yes! So I had this headache, chest pain, lightheadedness... all at once. And it was when I was workin', of course. Now, what were we talkin' about? Oh right! Work. It's been a real challenge focusin' on my tasks, ya know? My mind just wanders off like a squirrel in the park. (chuckles)

Now, let me think... what else did I say? Ah yes! The pain, it would start in my chest and radiate up to my head. And this lightheadedness, well, that's a new one for me. I thought maybe I just needed more coffee or somethin'. (laughs)

You know, I was at the grocery store yesterday, and I saw those coupons on the lettuce. I used to love cookin' with fresh veggies... my mother taught me how to make the fluffiest biscuits you ever tasted! (starts rambling) Oh dear, where's that recipe book? I think I lent it to the church bake sale committee...

Now, let me get back on track... So, this pain and dizziness started, like, two weeks ago. Maybe three? Time flies when you're havin' fun, doesn't it? (giggles) Anyway, since then, I just can't seem to concentrate. Simple tasks take me all day! My boss says I'm gettin' a little... forgetful. Now, don't tell her I said that. (whispers) It's a secret.

I hope you're listenin', doctor. Or is it nurse? (looks around the room) We should be on our way home now; my grandson has a birthday party to attend. I promised him we'd play some... umm, what was it again? Oh dear!"

It was like a sharp pain, right here (taps forehead). And then, I don't know how long it lasted, maybe 10 minutes? No, wait, was it longer than that? Anyway, I had chest pains too. I thought I might've overdone it with the rowin' machine. You know, Bob's son used to do rowin', he was quite good... (pauses) Oh, yes! My headache, it was gettin' worse. And then this dizziness came on. It's like my legs are made of jelly or somethin'. Hard to balance, ya know? Been that way since... hmm, when did I go for a walk with Margaret last week? (chuckles) Oh dear, not important now.""","I was in the middle of my exercise routine... you know, trying to keep up with that new young fellow at the gym... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, so I had this sudden... well, it felt like a band around my chest, but not just my chest, no sir. It was all over, like someone was squeezing me tight. And then there was this headache... Lord have mercy, it hurt something awful. I couldn't even see straight for a bit.

Now, I know what you're thinkin', ""What were you doin' that caused this?"" (pauses) Wait, where's my cane? I swear, I had it just a minute ago... Ah yes, so anyway, after the pain and dizziness started, I found myself havin' trouble balancin'. Walkin' from one end of the room to the other, I'd stumble over nothin'. And don't even get me started on tryin' to walk down the stairs. (chuckles) That was a real mess.

You see, when I'm at home, I like to sit in my favorite armchair... that's right, it's the one with the fancy cushion... and just watch TV for a bit. But now, even that seems too much effort. My wife always says I'm gettin' too old for this sorta thing... (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I met my wife? We went to... (stops suddenly) Oh dear me, where was I?

Oh yes, so it's been a few days now, and I've still got this trouble walkin'. And that chest pain comes back sometimes when I'm just relaxin' on the couch. I don't know what it is or how to make it go away. Do you think... (trails off)"

(chuckles) Sorry, where was I? Oh right. So, after that, walking around the house's been a problem. My balance, it's all wobbly-like. Can't seem to stand still without... (hesitates) you know, swaying a bit. Been like this for weeks now, or maybe months? Time sure flies by when you're busy watching TV.","I don't know what happened... one minute I'm lifting weights, next thing I know, I got a headache. Oh boy, that was somethin'. My chest hurt too, like a sharp pain right here... (taps on chest) and I felt dizzy, all wobbly. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast or something.

You know, I was just thinkin' about my wife's sister, Edna, she always said to take breaks when workin' out. Must've been 30 years ago... (chuckles) Lord have mercy. Okay, focus.

So this headache, it lingered on. And the dizziness... well, it still happens sometimes. Balance, you know? It's like my body's tryin' to tell me somethin'. But what is it sayin'? (pauses, looks around) I remember we used to have a big ol' tree in our backyard, and I'd climb up high, feel the wind... (trails off)

Now, about this balance business. It's like I'm standin' on one leg, but my other foot's movin' on its own. No, that's not right... (laughs) Oh dear. You see what I mean? Challengin', is all. Hard to explain. (pauses again) Wait, was that a commercial for Gerber meatloaf on the TV? Never mind.

But anyway... Like I said, I was driving home. Next thing I knew, I had a headache. It started right between the eyes... (touches forehead) Right here. Not too bad at first, but then it got worse.

And then there's the dizziness... (slows down) I've been having trouble driving lately... these new roads are quite confusing... (stammers) I-I mean, I was driving and everything, but my vision kept getting all wavy... Like when you're on that boat ride at the amusement park... You know, where it spins around? (giggles)

Now, I'm not one to complain, but it's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. Especially when I'm drivin'. Can't focus on the road no more. It's like my brain's gone foggy or somethin'. Dizziness too... Oh dear, what was that one word... dizz-... ya know? Yeah, that's it! And ever since then, I've been feelin' a bit... disconnected, I s'pose.

I remember, though, bein' at the farmer's market last weekend and seein' those lovely bunches of fresh herbs. Rosemary, thyme... Oh dear, what was I gettin' to? Ah yes! My symptoms! Well, like I said, it started with that headache, chest discomfort, and dizziness. Now I'm just tryin' to get through the day without feelin' like my world's turned upside down.

I was thinkin', though... (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time I visited my cousin in Florida? Nice place, nice people... anyway... I don't know what it is, but this chest discomfort keeps me up at night. Like a naggin' little voice in my head. Can't shake it off."

So, this headache was bothering me, and then... (pauses, searching for words) ...and then I started feeling pangs in my chest. Not like indigestion or anything; no, it was more... like a squeezing. You know how your heart beats sometimes? It's all fast and fluttery? That's what this felt like.

And then there was the dizziness. Goodness gracious, it's hard to explain! (laughs) I think I might have gotten up too quickly from that bench over by the cosmetics... you know, the one with the nice perfume lady? Anyway, after that... my head just spun around. Like a top! (giggles)

Oh dear, I'm all mixed up now! It's been hard for me to... to concentrate on anything since it happened.

Anyway, it's all a bit fuzzy now. I think that's when I started feelin' the dizziness too. Like the room was spinning round and round... (pauses) Now what were we talkin' about again?"
96,Hypertension,"I felt good when I woke up this morning, but as the day wore on, I began to feel headachey, sick to my stomach, and dizzy. Since then, it has been challenging for me to concentrate and focus on my work.","Oh dear doctor... I felt good when I woke up this morning, yes, I was up early as usual... made myself a cup of tea... and then I started thinking about that garden show I saw last week on TV... anyway... (pauses) Oh, what was the question? Ah yes... so, by mid-morning, I started feeling... you know, headachey. And my stomach was doing flips... or is it just indigestion? I get those sometimes after eating too much bread. (chuckles) My sister Edna always says I eat too much bread... (trails off) Anyway, as the day went on, I felt dizzy and had trouble focusing... concentrate, you know? Can't seem to sit still or remember what I was doing. (pauses again) Now, where's my reading glasses?","Doc... anyway, I woke up this morning, felt fine, you know, nothin' out of sorts. But as the day went on, I started feelin' a little... headachey. Yeah, my head was achin', like someone was poundin' away in there. And then, stomach's been doin' flips all day. I mean, I had some toast and coffee for breakfast, and that usually holds me over 'til lunchtime, but today... (pauses) 

You know what's funny? Last week, I think it was a Thursday, I had that same sensation. But then I realized, no, that was just the arthritis in my neck actin' up again. This is different, though. I'm gettin' all dizzy and lightheaded... (trails off) 

Oh, look at that picture on your wall! That's a nice vase you got there. (pauses to look around the room) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. Concentrate, focus... it's like tryin' to remember somethin' important, but it's just outta reach. Work's been sufferin', too. Can't seem to get a thing done without feelin' like I'm gonna pass out or somethin'. (pauses again) 

Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I could've sworn... (snaps back to the conversation) Ah, yes! My symptoms. So, it's been goin' on all day now. Maybe I should just take a nap and see if that clears my head? Or maybe I need some of them newfangled painkillers you young folks are always talkin' about... (trails off once more)"
97,Hypertension,"I was in the middle of a meeting when I suddenly developed a headache, chest pain, and dizziness. It's been hard for me to focus and concentrate on the discussion since then.","Oh dear... (pauses) Excuse me, doc... I was in this meeting, you know, at the office? And suddenly, out of nowhere, my head started hurting something awful. Not just a little headache, either. It was like someone took a hammer to my temples. (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, I was trying to talk about quarterly sales reports... and then it hit me.

Chest pains started coming on too. Felt like someone sat on me or something. (pauses) Where's my pen? Ah, yes, the meeting. Dizziness, it was like being on a boat in rough seas. Can't concentrate worth beans... I mean, what were we discussing again? (trails off)

Now, where did I put that report...? No, no, focus! It's been... um... well, I think it's been at least an hour since it started, but time flies when you're in pain like this. (sighs)","I was in a meeting, yeah... was supposed to be discussing quarterly sales figures... but then I got this... headache, you know? Right here, just behind my eye. And I'm thinkin', what's goin' on with me now? Can't even focus no more. (pauses)

You know, I remember when my husband used to get headaches like that. He'd say it was from work stress... or maybe the garden gnomes in our yard were botherin' him again. (chuckles) Oh dear, what was I talkin' about? Ah yes, the meeting.

Anyway, where was I? Right... so I got this headache and suddenly my chest feels tight too. Like someone's squeezin' my heart or somethin'. And dizzy, oh boy, it's like I'm swaying on a boat or somethin'! (laughs) Reminds me of that one time I went to the lake with the grandkids... they were swingin' from the rope and...

(suddenly serious again) Wait, no, no, this is important. This dizziness business. You see, it's not just standin' up or walkin', it's like when you're sittin' there and then suddenly the room starts to spin around you. I don't know how to explain it... (pauses, looks around the room) Now, what was I sayin'? Oh yes! The pain! It's been gettin' worse since I got back from that meeting, but like I said, I couldn't focus no more.

You see, my grandson had a similar thing happen at school once. Turned out he was allergic to... (pauses, thinks) what was it? Oh dear, now I forgot! Uh, doesn't matter. So anyway... this has been goin' on for... (pauses again) What day is today?"
98,Hypertension,"I suddenly experienced a headache, chest pain, and dizziness in the middle of a conference. Since then, it has been challenging for me to concentrate and focus on the topic.","You know, I was at this conference... (pauses) Oh, what's that thingamajig we were supposed to talk about? Ah yes, marketing strategies. Anyway... (chuckles) I got up to give my presentation and suddenly I had this awful headache, right here (taps forehead). And then, oh dear me, my chest started hurting like a dog's been biting it. (giggles) My grandson has a dachshund, you know? Named Bubbles... (trails off)

Oh yes, the pain! It was in the middle of my chest, and I felt dizzy too. Like when I used to get those spinning headaches as a child, remember those? What's that name of the medication they gave me for it? Ah well, never mind. Since then, focusing on anything has been like trying to read a book through... (pauses) what's that word? A foggy lens! You know how it is when you wear your glasses and they get all steamy?

Anyway, my head still hurts, and I have this chest pain, and dizziness. And I just can't seem to... concentrate, yes, that's the word. Can't focus on anything. (sighs) It's been three days now... or is it four? Time sure flies when you're having fun! (laughs softly)","I don't know what's gotten into me lately... (pauses) Wait, where was I going today? Ah yes, this conference thingy... anyway, I suddenly felt a big ol' headache come out of nowhere! Right between the eyes, it was. And my chest, oh boy, I thought I was gonna pass out or something. Felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my chest. (chuckles) Like that one time at the church picnic...

Uh, what was I saying? Oh right, my chest pain! It's still bothering me some. And dizzy... goodness gracious, I felt so lightheaded. Had to grab onto the podium for support. Don't know how I didn't fall over, (laughs nervously) guess that's a good thing!

Anyway, ever since this happened, it's been mighty difficult concentrating on anything. Focusing on talks or papers... (pauses, looks off into distance) Reminds me of my son-in-law's cousin... no, wait, not him. My nephew, Larry! What was his story again? Ah yes, the car accident... (trails off)

Now where was I? Oh right, concentrating. It's like trying to watch a tennis match – too much for my old brain. Can't seem to keep track of what they're saying or why it matters. Even when I try to pay attention, my mind starts drifting... and then I remember... the thing with the groceries! (chuckles) How did that get me thinking about chicken? Uh-oh, where's my thoughts going now?

So yeah, headaches and chest pain, dizziness too... (pauses again) Hmm, what was it like at this conference before all this happened? (thinks for a moment) I think we were discussing some new research or something. Must've been important if they brought the whole department to talk about it..."
99,Hypertension,"I have been feeling fine all day, but suddenly developed a headache, chest pain, and dizziness while out for a run. It's been hard for me to maintain my balance since then","You know, I was fine this mornin', got up early, went for a run... and then all of a sudden, wham! Headache came outta nowhere, like a storm cloud on a sunny day. And my chest, it started hurtin' too... (pauses) You'd think it's just indigestion from the chili I had last night, but no sir... it's more than that. Dizziness is what really gets me - can't seem to balance myself no more. Must be all these new medicines I'm on, don't you think? Uh, which ones are they again? (chuckles) Ah yes, the important things! Now where was I? Oh right... headache and chest pain, that's been goin' on for a few hours now...","I don't know, I've been feelin' just fine all day, goin' about my business... but then suddenly... (pauses) what was I talkin' about? Oh yeah! Headache. It just came out of nowhere, like a storm cloud. No warning, nothin'. Just this big ol' ache right here (taps forehead). And chest pain too. I know it sounds crazy, but it feels like someone's takin' my breath away. Can't catch my wind, you know? (chuckles) Reminds me of when I was a young man, runnin' track in high school...

Oh dear, what was the other thing? Ah yes! Dizziness. It's been hard for me to maintain my balance since... well, since it started, I suppose. (pauses again) Now let me think back on that. Was it after I ate breakfast? No, no, I'm sure it wasn't. (trails off) Did I mention the toast was a bit burnt? Always happens when I'm in a hurry... anyway...

Now where was I? Ah yes! Runnin'. I was out for a run this mornin', just enjoying the fresh air... and that's when it hit me, I reckon. (pauses once more) Wait, what were we talkin' about again? Oh dear, I hope I didn't miss anythin' important... (chuckles nervously)

You know, it's funny. My sister used to get these headaches all the time too. Always said they came from her neck or somethin'. Never did figure out what caused 'em... (gets sidetracked) Speakin' of my sister, I was just thinkin' about that family reunion we had last year... what a wonderful day! We had the most delicious potato salad..."

Anyway, my back and neck, they hurt somethin' awful. And these dizzy spells, they come outta nowhere. I'm walkin' down the hall, and suddenly I'm stumble-stepin' like a fool. Can't even balance myself no more. My arms and legs, they feel heavy, like lead weights or somethin'. What's goin' on with me, anyway?","I don't know if I'm getting this right...

(chuckles nervously) Wait, no, I remember when it started. We were on vacation in Florida and I had the worst cold ever. My grandson got it too, bless his heart...

Now, my neck, that's a different story altogether. (pauses to collect thoughts) It feels like... well, you know how your shoulder blades can get all tight and sore? That's what it is. Except it's my neck. And I'm feeling just terrible in my legs, too. My doctor back home said it was just arthritis, but... (trails off)

You see, we were at the beach and I saw this big ol' dolphin jumping out of the water! Never seen anything like it before. Reminded me of those shows on TV where they're swimming with dolphins... (distracted) Anyway...

Oh yes, my back! And that cough, I've been up all night, coughing just to clear my throat. Dizzy spells, too. I'll be walking down the street and suddenly I'm lightheaded. Don't know what it is, but... (shakes head) Ah, dear me...

Can you tell me what time it is? I think I got here a little early, didn't I?"

Limb weakness, that's been goin' on for weeks now... can barely lift my groceries anymore. Just stand there tryin' to remember what I was gonna do with 'em... (chuckles nervously) Get a little mixed up sometimes, ya know? Like the other day, I thought it was Thursday already! (laughs)

Now, let's see... neck pain too, been noddin' my head like this for months now. Neck just don't wanna hold still no more. And then there's them dizzy spells... vertigo or somethin', that's what the nurse said. Instability? Is that when you're walkin' and your feet just slip right out from under ya? (pauses) Wait, was I supposed to get some new shoes?

Oh dear Lord, it all just gets so jumbled up in my head now... my daughter says I'm gettin' forgetful. Don't know what's important no more... like that recipe for the best chicken soup ever... where did I put that? (pauses) Ah yes! My back. It's just killin' me, doc. Killin' me slow."

I was up there last week, gettin' out the old trunk... (pauses) Wait, when was that again? Oh, back to my symptoms. My arms and legs feel weak, like noodles. Can barely hold a cup of tea. And this neck pain, it's like someone's pinchin' me all day. Dizziness, yeah, I get dizzy sometimes. Don't know what triggers it. (pauses) Did I mention I saw your nephew at the grocery store? Nice young fella...","I don't know if I'm doing this right... back pain, that's been going on for weeks now.

My arms and legs, they just feel so weak all the time. Like when I try to lift my grandkids' toys, I get this cramp in my arm and it takes me a few tries to even move my fingers. (pauses) Did I tell you about that new coffee maker we got? It's just like the one from last year but with more buttons... anyway...

And my neck, it hurts too. Just below where my hairline is... you know, when I turn my head too quickly or something. Like when I was driving to the post office and I saw a squirrel on the side of the road and I slammed on my brakes... (chuckles) Ah, those squirrels...

Dizziness, balance problems... (hesitates) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes! We went to that nice Italian restaurant last week and I had this big plate of spaghetti with meatballs.

It's been gettin' worse since... hmm, let me think... we went to the beach last summer. Must've breathed in some sand or somethin'. My neck hurts too, like someone's put a big ol' knot in there.

And my arms and legs, they feel all numb. Can't even feel my toes no more. That's why I fell down that one time... you know, when we went to the farmer's market? (pauses) No, wait, that was last week. Felt dizzy and stuff. Haven't been doin' too well on them new medicines, if you know what I mean. Lightheaded all the time now. Shoulda stuck with the ol' aspirin. Don't need these fancy pills makin' me feel like... like... uh... a boat in the storm, you see? (chuckles) Now, where was I? Ah yes, back pain and numbness.

(pauses) Oh dear, my back... it's been aching something awful, especially after I... uh... what was that thing I did last week? (chuckles) Ah yes, I went to the church social and lifted some heavy boxes... anyway... (clears throat)

Now, where were we? Ah yes, my back. So, it hurts when I breathe in, like a squeezing feeling. And my legs, they feel so weak... (hesitates) Wait, was that the new medication you gave me last time? (pauses again) Oh dear, what was its name? Never mind...

And don't even get me started on this vertigo business. I'll be walking down the street and suddenly, wham! The world starts spinning. Like when I was a girl... we used to play on the merry-go-round at the park... (trails off) Oh yes, balance problems. That's it.

And my neck... Lord have mercy, it throbs like nobody's business. Sometimes it hurts so bad I just want to hold onto something... you know what I mean? A nice sturdy chair or... or a big oak tree... (pauses once more)

What was that thing we were talking about again? Ah yes, my symptoms! So, it's all these things: back pain, trouble breathing, weak limbs, dizziness... and don't forget the neck. (stammers) Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up now...

Oh wait, what's this picture on your wall? That one with the trees and the lake? My sister used to take me there when we were young... (gets sidetracked) We'd have picnics by the water..."

Dry as the Sahara desert out here. Can't seem to get any moisture goin' on. My throat feels like sandpaper, dear.

Wait, what was I talkin' about again? Oh yes! The pain. It's been like this for... um... *taps forehead* ... three days now? Maybe four? Hmm, could've sworn it started last week, but that's not important right now, is it?

My neck hurts too, ya know? Like someone gave me a big ol' swat on the back of my head. I don't like that one bit! *rubs neck* Ooh, and then there's this dizziness... *sighs* Feels like I'm floatin' above my feet most of the time. Steady as a rock, they say, but not me! Not anymore, no sirree.

Lately, everything seems foggy to me. Can't remember where I put my tea mug or what day it is... *chuckles* Oh dear, got up this mornin' thinkin' it was Tuesday, but then I saw that big ol' window with the calendar on it, and it said Thursday! What in tarnation? *laughs*

Limb weakness, too. Can barely lift a bag of groceries without wincin'. My nephew came over the other day and he said, ""Granny, you're as weak as a kitten!"" (chuckles) Young whippersnapper, always tryin' to make me laugh. But between you and me, it's not funny.

Dizzy spells, you see... (pauses to think) I was makin' eggs the other morning and suddenly felt like I was goin' over on my feet. Scared the cat, that one. Poor thing. Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the dizziness. It's been happenin' a lot lately.

Limb weakness, you said? That's right! My left leg feels like lead sometimes. And my neck, oh dear... it hurts when I turn my head. Do you think that's from bending down to water the plants in my garden? (chuckles) Those hydrangeas need regular watering, don't they?

I've also been feeling a bit... disoriented, I suppose is the word. Weak on my feet, like I might fall over at any moment.

Weakness in my limbs, yeah... that's a new one. Like when you're gettin' older and your legs just give out from under ya. You know, like tryin' to carry them heavy grocery bags all by yourself. (laughs) Course, I'm not carryin' nothin' these days, bless my heart...

Now, my neck... oh boy, that's been sore for weeks! My chiropractor said it was probably just a pinched nerve, but then he gave me one of those weird stretches and now my arm's all funny.

And then there's these other things... (hesitates) My neck, it feels like I got hit by a truck. No, not literally... just feels stiff and sore. And them arms and legs, they just feel weak, you know? Like I'm walkin' through the mud or somethin'. Dizziness, loss of balance... it's all comin' together, if you will. (pauses) What was that other thing I wanted to tell ya about? Oh yes! My granddaughter's birthday party last weekend... she's gettin' so big now... and her cake, Lord have mercy... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, the dizziness. It's been goin' on for months, I think. Maybe it's just too much coffee in the mornin'. (laughs)","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right...

(chuckles) Anyway, my back's been killin' me for months now.

And this cough... (coughs weakly) Excuse me, sorry 'bout that. It's just stuck on me like a bad cold, but it won't go away. Can't get nothin' down without bringin' it up again. My wife says I'm probably gettin' too old for all these health problems... (laughs) What was I sayin'? Ah yes, my cough.

I've been feelin' so weak lately... in my arms and legs, you know? Can't even carry groceries no more without needin' to take a break. (pauses, looks around the room) Did I used to have a garden out back? My wife always said I was good with plants... (sighs)

And my neck... that's all stiff too. Don't know what I did to it, but it feels like somethin' caught up in there. (taps neck) Can't turn my head without gettin' a headache now. Then there's the dizziness... (spins head quickly) Whoa! Sorry 'bout that. I feel like I'm walkin' around on eggshells, afraid of fallin' over or somethin'.

I swear, I had the best doctor's appointment ever with Dr. Smith back in 1982... (trails off) Oh dear, what was it about again?"

Uh, what were we talkin' about again? Oh right! My symptoms. So, it's been like this for weeks now... I don't know if you've noticed, but my clothes are gettin' a little tight around the middle. Must be from eatin' too many of those fried chicken sandwiches at the diner...

And these dizzy spells I'm having... they're so frustrating! I was walking from the living room to the kitchen just yesterday, and suddenly I felt like I was spinning around in circles.

(chuckles) Weakness in arms and legs, is what it feels like. Can't quite put my finger on it.

My neck hurts, too... or is that where the pain's coming from? I mean, I've been having trouble sleeping, lying on this pillow, and... uh... oh yes! The night before last, I was watching my favorite show, ""As Time Goes By""... no, wait, I think that was the day before. Anyway, it's all gotten a bit jumbled in my head.

Off-balance and woozy... (laughs) reminds me of the time I fell on my ice skates when I was a young lass! You remember that one, don't you? Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, balance. Sometimes I stumble over nothing at all. It's like... well, you know what it feels like when you're trying to adjust your glasses while driving? (laughs) Never mind.

Oh, and another thing: I've been having trouble with my teeth. Can't remember if I brushed them this morning or not... or was it yesterday? (chuckles nervously) Oh dear, all these memories, they just won't stay still! Sorry, doc... where's my tea, anyway?"

Now, about this cough... it's a real doozy. Got me worried, it has. Produces a lot of phlegm... (pauses) Wait, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Phlegm! That's the thing.

Ah yes, stomach ache... real bad cramps and all that. Never felt this way before in my life. Hope it's not them gallstones again... or is it the liver? (laughs nervously)

(Fade into a gentle humming noise, as if lost in thought)"
209,Jaundice,I have been feeling itchy and have been vomiting. I am also very fatigued and have lost weight. My fever is high and my skin has become yellow. My urine is dark and I have abdominal pain,"You know, Doc... or should I say, Dr... uh, Smith? Anyway, I've been feelin' quite poorly lately. Itchy, ya see. All over my body, it is. My arms, legs, back... even my ears! Can you believe that? (chuckles) Reminds me of the time I went fishin' with Joe... or was it Bob? Ah, anyway...

As for the other symptoms, well... I've been havin' trouble keepin' food down. Vomitin', they call it, don't they? (pauses to collect thoughts) Yes, that's what I said. And fatigue, oh boy... I'm as tired as a hound dog in July. Lost some weight, too. Not that I mind, but my wife says I look a bit... gaunt. Yellow skin, like a dandelion, I reckon? (giggles) Don't know what's causin' it all, but... and the urine, dear me! It's as dark as the coffee we had for breakfast. And this pain in my tummy... Lord have mercy!","I've been feelin' so itchy, doc... it's like my skin is crawlin'. I mean, I was readin' a book about that once, where people had this itchin' all over... (pauses) Wait, what was the name of that book? Oh yes, ""The Yellow Wallpaper""... no, not just yellow, but itchy too. Anyway, I've been scratchin' like crazy, and my poor hands are all red.

Now, about these other things... I've been vomitin' a lot lately. Not just little bits, either – big helpin's. (pauses) You know what was funny? My niece's kid had a bad case of the hiccups once, and we had to take him to the ER. They said it was nothing, but I swear, that child hiccuped for hours! (chuckles)

Oh yes, as I was sayin', the vomitin'... it's been goin' on for weeks now. And I'm so tired all the time – just can't seem to get no rest. Lost weight too... (pauses) Used to be able to eat a whole pizza by myself, but now I'm lucky if I can finish a sandwich.

Fever's high, my skin is yellow like a banana... or maybe that's the onions? (laughs) Oh dear, sorry 'bout that. My urine, it's all dark... like coffee. And this pain in my tummy... (pauses) You know what they say about stomach troubles? Something about your innards being out of wack... (trails off)

Abdominal pain, that's what you said I had... (looks around the room) Now where did I put that book I was tellin' you about?"
210,Jaundice,"I've been feeling scratchy and throwing up. I have lost weight and am also really exhausted. My skin has become yellow, and I have a severe fever. I have stomach ache and black urine.","Doc... um... what was your name again? Oh yes, Dr. Smith! Anyway, I've been feeling real scratchy, like my throat is all inflamed and stuff. And then there's this throwing up business. I mean, it's not just a little bit, it's constant. Like, every morning after breakfast. (pauses) You know what's funny? My grandson Jimmy used to love breakfast too! (chuckles)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes... the weight loss. It's like my appetite just disappeared. And then there's the exhaustion. I get tired just thinking about getting out of bed. (sighs) My skin's turned all yellow, and that fever's been plaguing me for weeks now. Stomach ache's been constant too. And don't even get me started on this black urine business... (pauses, looks puzzled) Is it Tuesday?","I... uh... been feelin' pretty crummy for a while now... (pauses) You know, I was just thinkin', we should've gone to the beach last week like we planned, nice weather we had... anyway... scratchy throat, yeah, that's it. Can't seem to swallow nothin' without gettin' this awful scratchin' feelin'. And then there's this... (hesitates) you know when you eat somethin' and it just doesn't sit right? That's me all the time now. Threw up this mornin', yeah, again. And I just can't seem to keep nothin' down.

Lately... (pauses, collecting thoughts) Oh boy, where was I? Ah yes! Weight loss. I swear, I've lost a good five pounds since Christmas. Must be all that gardenin' I did last year... (chuckles) That's when I had my hip replacement, and then there was the time I... (stops, lost in thought)

Ugh, and this exhaustion business? Shoot, I just can't seem to catch a break no more. Can barely make it from the couch to the kitchen without needin' a nap. Get up, grab a snack, back to bed... (sighs) My skin's all yellowish now... must be some kinda liver thingy... always worried about my liver, I am.

Severe fever? Yeah, that's what the nurse said last week when she came over for check-ups. Don't rightly know if I've had it this long or not. Stomach hurts somethin' fierce all the time... and now my pee is all dark brown like coffee. No joke!"
211,Jaundice,"I've been itchy and have been throwing up. Along with losing weight, I'm also really exhausted. My skin has turned yellow, and my fever is high. Additionally, I get stomach ache and dark urine.","You know, doc... (pauses) I was just at the Early Bird Special yesterday and they had those lovely prime ribs... anyway... (chuckles) I've been feeling quite itchy, yes, itchiness all over my body. And then there's this vomiting business... I mean, I'm not a morning person to begin with, but this is getting ridiculous. (pauses again) Weight's just melting off me, too. No appetite at all. Always so tired, like an old cat napping in the sun... (hesitates) What was I saying? Ah yes, exhaustion! My skin looks like a banana or something – yellow as can be. Fever's been running high, night and day, I think... (confused tone) When did I get this fever again? Yesterday? No, the day before... doesn't matter, anyway... My tummy's always hurting, too. And when I go to the bathroom, it comes out dark as coffee. (trails off)","I'm so sorry to bother you again, doc... or is it nurse? I always get those two mixed up... (chuckles) Anyway... this itching business, it's been going on for weeks now. Can't even sleep at night because of it. It's like ants crawling all over my skin, I kid you not. And the throwing up, oh dear lord... I've lost count of how many times I've gotten sick to my stomach this week alone. 

And then there's the weight loss. I know I should be proud of myself for getting thinner, but it's just not right, is it? I mean, I'm 72 years old, for Pete's sake... (pauses) Now, where did I put that prescription I need to fill? Ah yes... (trails off)

You see, my skin, it's turned this awful shade of yellow. Not just a little bit, either... it's like someone poured a bottle of mustard all over me. And don't even get me started on the fever. It's like a furnace burning inside my chest. Can I get some water, please? (pauses) Oh, yes! My stomach ache... that's what's been keeping me up at night. Like someone's punching me from the inside out.

And dark urine... isn't that one of those things you always hear about in old people's stories? ""My urine's turned yellow!"" Yeah... mine has too. (chuckles awkwardly)"
212,Jaundice,"I've had a scratchy stomach and been throwing up. Aside from losing weight, I am also really exhausted. I have a high fever and yellow skin. Besides having stomach ache, my pee is black.","I've been feelin' terrible for... um, I don't know, a week or two now? Maybe longer? My stomach's been scratchy and I've been throwin' up all the time. Losin' weight, too. It's like my clothes are hangin' off me again just like when I lost that last 10 pounds after I went to Hawaii with the church group... oh boy, those were the days! (chuckles) Anyway... and then there's this exhaustion. I'm tired all the time, even after sleepin'. And my fever's been runnin' high, yellow skin too. My husband said it looks like I've got jaundice or somethin'. Now, let me think... where did I put that calendar? (pauses) Oh yeah! And my pee, dear Lord... it's black as coal. I know it sounds crazy, but...","I'm so glad you're here, Doctor... I don't know what's been going on with me lately... my stomach's been feelin' all scratchy and stuff... and then the vomiting started, oh dear... (pauses to collect thoughts) Weight's gone down a bit, too... but that's not the worst of it... (clears throat) I'm just so tired all the time, like I could sleep for days... and my fever... well, you can take my temperature if you want, but I think it's been high... real high... (gets sidetracked) Now, let me think... when was I last at church? Ah yes! The potluck... I made that nice casserole... (chuckles) My stomach would churn just thinkin' about eatin' all that food now...

Anyway, my skin's turned yellow, Doctor... you can see it if you want... (starts to lift shirt but hesitates) Oh dear, where did I put those papers? Ah yes! The prescription for... uh, whatever it was. Now, let me start again. This vomiting business... and my stomach, like a rock, feels all crampy... and this fever... I swear, sometimes I'm hot, sometimes cold, just can't seem to get comfortable... (mutters to self) Must remember to take the trash out tomorrow...

And then there's the pee, Doctor... it's been black as coal... (looks puzzled) Like when you burn a piece of paper? My grandfather used to do that all the time... (trails off) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! The urine. Now, now, let me think about what might be causing this... (pauses, eyes glazed over)"
213,Jaundice,"I've been itchy and throwing up. In addition, I have lost weight and feel really exhausted. My skin has become yellow and I have a severe temperature. I have abdominal ache and black urine.","""I've been feelin' just awful for... well, I'm not sure how long now. My skin's all yellowish, and I have this terrible itchiness all over my body. Can't stop scratchin'. And then there's the vomiting. It's like somethin' inside me is tryin' to get out. Lost some weight, too... can't say exactly how much. Feel so tired, just want to sleep all day. Fever's been real high, at least 100 degrees I'm sure of that. Stomach hurts somethin' fierce, like someone's twistin' a knife in there. And my urine, well... it's dark, almost black. Reminds me of the time I saw that movie, 'That Thing You Do', with Tom Hanks... nice film... anyway... Ah, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, my symptoms...""","Oh dearie me... I've been feelin' just awful lately. Itchiness all over my body, can't stop scratchin', even in my sleep. And then there's the throwin' up, you know? Must be at least three times a day now. Can't keep nothin' down, poor thing... (pauses to think)

I've lost so much weight, it's just dreadful. My clothes are hangin' off me like a rag doll. And I'm as tired as an old horse, Lord have mercy... Can barely get out of bed in the mornin'. (gets distracted) You know, my sister had this same problem with her gallstones. Had to get 'em removed and all... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes, yellow skin. It's just gotten so pale, you see. Almost like a ghostly complexion. And the temperature, dearie me! Must be 103 degrees or more, I'd say. Fever's got me shiverin' like a leaf... (stops suddenly) Wait, wasn't it my brother who had the high fever? Or was it my husband? Oh dear, can't seem to recall...

Oh, and then there's this ache in my belly... (winces) Just feels like someone's stuck a knife right through me. And don't even get me started on the black urine! It's just... (stammers) I mean, what does it mean when your pee turns black? Is that normal? (chuckles nervously)

Anyway, that's my story. Hope you can make some sense of it all. Now, where did I put my teeth?..."
214,Jaundice,"I've been exhausted and experiencing nausea and itching. In addition, I've lost weight and have a temperature. My urine is dark, and my skin has turned yellow. Additionally, I've been having stomach pain.","Doc, you know that new rug in my living room? I just got it yesterday... no, wait, was it today? Anyway... (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm so tired all the time. Can't even make it through a whole day without needing a nap. And this nausea's been plaguing me for... um... let me think, must be at least two weeks now. My stomach's been acting up something fierce. It hurts down there (points to abdomen) and I'm getting this itching on my skin, you know? Yellow, it is. Just like buttercups in spring. (pauses) What was I saying? Ah yes, the yellow skin. And my urine... well, it's darker than usual. More brownish. Like coffee, almost. Weight loss too. Can't say exactly how much, but I feel lighter somehow. Fever's been there for a while now... or is that just this morning?","(sigh) Oh dear, doc... (pauses) I don't know if I'm getting this right. You see, I've been feeling just terrible for weeks now. Can't seem to shake it off. (muttering to self) Must remember to pick up milk on the way home... Ah yes! The symptoms. (clears throat)

Exhaustion, that's a big one. I mean, I'm always tired, but this is different. Like someone's taken all my energy and left me feeling like a bag of potatoes. (chuckles) My wife says it's because I've been doing too much yard work... (pauses) No, no, not just that.

Now, the itching... it started on my arms first, then spread to my legs. Like those awful mosquito bites, but these don't itch, they burn. (frowns) Must have gotten some insecticide on me or something. I think I was cleaning the garage last week... 

Weight loss is a concern, of course. My scale's been lying to me for years now – either it's broken or my metabolism's just shot. I mean, I used to be able to eat an entire pizza by myself and not gain an ounce! (laughs) Now, I'm lucky if I can finish a slice without feeling like I've swallowed a brick.

Temperature? Ah yes... That would be the fever. Always the same at night – around 4 am. I've been taking Tylenol, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. Just gets hotter and hotter until I'm dripping sweat all over the sheets. (exasperated sigh) Skin turning yellow? Well, that's just plain worrisome... Must be due to the itching cream my niece recommended – that or those supplements I've been taking for my joints. 

Oh dear me! Stomach pain... just get up and walk around it, you know? Like a stubborn headache. Can't remember when it started exactly. Last Tuesday at church maybe? Or was it... (trails off)

Urine's dark, like tea – just like grandma used to make. Always said it meant I needed more vitamin C or something... But my doctor at the time assured me it was just kidney stones... (frowning) Hmm, think I took some of those for a while...

You see, doc... what with all this running on in my head and losing weight and fever, I thought maybe it's the cancer. We found out that cousin of mine had it last year... or was it the other way around?"
215,Jaundice,"I have been suffering from itching, vomiting, and fatigue. I have also lost weight and have a high fever. My skin has turned yellow and my urine is dark. I have also been experiencing abdominal pain","Oh dear doctor... I've been feeling just awful lately. Itching, you see... all over my body. Can't even sit still because of it. Vomiting too, poor thing. Last week... or was it this week? Hmm, wait, what was the date again? Ah yes, and fatigue, just exhausted all the time. Like when I used to walk to school uphill, both ways! (chuckles) Oh dear, and the weight loss... my clothes are hanging off me like a rag doll.

Fever's been high, like someone lit a fire in my head. Skin's turned yellow, like butter... or is that mustard? Can never remember. Urine's dark as coffee too. And this pain in my belly... it's just been there for... (pauses) well, I don't know how long now. Days? Weeks? Oh dear me, doctor... (trails off)","I'm so worried about this thing that's happening to me... (pauses) Oh dear, I don't know where I put my reading glasses... anyway, I've been feeling just awful lately. My skin has turned all yellow, like I ate too much turmeric again, you know? Or was it mustard? (chuckles) No, no, that's not it... I mean, I'm sure it's nothing, but the itching is just terrible! On my legs, arms, even my face. Can't sleep at night because of it.

And then there's this vomiting. (pauses to collect thoughts) Vomiting? Is that what they call it when you throw up a lot? (looks around) I'm sure I had some of those new tea bags... ah yes, lemon and ginger. Maybe that's it. Anyway, it's not the tea, I'm telling you! (laughs)

Now, where was I? Oh yes, vomiting. It's been happening for days now. And fatigue? Good Lord, I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I've lost some weight too, which isn't a bad thing, per se... my mother always said I should lose a few pounds... (trails off)

But what really worries me is this fever. It's like someone turned up the thermostat in here! (laughs) And the urine? Oh dear, it's like coffee or something. Dark as coal, I kid you not.

And then there's this... (pauses, struggling to recall) abdominal pain. Yes, that's what they call it when your stomach hurts, right? (looks at doctor with a questioning gaze)"
216,Jaundice,"I've been feeling scratchy, sick, and worn out. I also had a high fever and lost weight. Both my skin and my urine have become yellow. Additional stomach pain that I've been having","You know, Doc... I've been feelin' just terrible lately. Scratchy throat, like someone's sandpaperin' it away. And I'm always gettin' sick, if you know what I mean. Can't shake this tiredness off either. (pauses) You know, my granddaughter was over the other day and we were bakin' cookies... anyway... (clears throat) High fever, must've been a few days ago? No, wait, was it last week? Ah, doesn't matter now... I just remember bein' all hot and sweaty. Lost some weight too, can see that in the mirror. My skin's turned yellow like the sunflowers in my garden, and so has my urine... or is it the other way around? (chuckles) And this stomach pain... (pauses again) Now, what was I sayin'? Oh yes, the pain... been havin' a lot of trouble with that too.","I don't know if this is important, but I've been feeling real poorly lately... scratchy, you know? Like my throat's on fire again. And I'm tired all the time, worn out. Can't hardly get out of bed some mornings. Had a fever, I think it was 102, might've been higher. My daughter said I looked like death warmed over. And I lost weight, too... (pauses) I wonder if I should start eating more soup again? It's so easy to heat up a can... anyway...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the fever and all. So, that was about three weeks ago now. Since then, my skin's been feeling kinda... prickly. And it looks yellow, too. Not just my skin, though - my urine's turned yellow as well. I'm sure that's not normal. (pauses to collect thoughts) I remember when my husband used to get sick, he'd always have these big glasses of water... no, wait, that was the time we went on that trip...

Oh dear me, where did that thought go? Right! The stomach pain. It's been going on for weeks now. Sharp pains, mostly in the mornings after breakfast. I've tried to eat smaller meals, but it doesn't seem to help... (pauses again) My sister's husband had ulcers once. Wasn't it terrible? He was on all sorts of medicines..."
217,Jaundice,"The itch, the nausea, and the weariness have been bothering me. In addition, I developed a fever and lost weight. My pee is black, and I've developed a yellow rash. Additionally, I've had stomach ache.","The itch, the nausea, and the weariness have been botherin' me somethin' fierce. I swear, it started when my cousin Edna came over for dinner, but was it last week or two weeks ago? Anyway... In addition to that, I developed a fever and lost weight. Now, I know I've been eatin' my veggies, but I'm just plumb tuckered out all the time. My pee is black as coal, and I've got this yellow rash on my arms. It itches like crazy! And, oh boy, I had stomach ache so bad yesterday... or was that Tuesday? Ah, shoot, what's the date today anyway? Oh, and I almost forgot – my niece's cat came over and knocked over a vase... (chuckles) Where was I?","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... (pauses) Oh dear, where did I put my teeth? Ah yes, here they are! (chuckles) Anyway, you see, Doc... or is it Doctor Smith? No, wait, that's not right... (trails off)

Oh yes, the itch. It's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. Can't sleep at night from scratchin'. My arms, legs, even my face. I think it's a bug bite or somethin', but it just won't go away. And the nausea... (pauses to collect thoughts) You know, I was talkin' to my friend Ethel the other day, and she said her brother had something like this once... (stares off into space)

Fever's been high for days now. Don't feel like eatin' much neither. Lost some weight, I think. (pauses, looks around) Where did I put my glasses? Ah yes... My pee is black, that's what the doctor said last time. Don't know what to make of it myself. Yellow rash on my arms and chest. Must be some sorta infection, I reckon.

And stomach ache... (trails off) You know, I was at the park yesterday, and I saw this big ol' tree with branches all over the place. I wonder if they're still paintin' that fence around the pond... (pauses, looks confused)

Oh dear, what was I talkin' about again? Ah yes, my symptoms! (laughs nervously)"

And then there's this exhaustion... I don't know what it is, but I just wanna sleep all the time. Weight loss too... 5 pounds in two weeks? That's gotta be wrong, right? My urine... well, let me tell ya, it's like coffee or somethin'! Black as coal. And my skin... yellowish, you know? Stomach pain, that's a new one for me.

Nausea and vomiting, that's a given. And I'm just as exhausted as... (trails off) Did I mention I saw the most peculiar film on TV last night? No, no, never mind. Focus, focus.

I've lost weight, can't say how much, but it feels like pounds. My sister-in-law was here for dinner last week and she commented on my thinning hair... (pauses) Wait a minute, what were we talkin' about again?

Temperature's up, don't know why. Must be that new medication I'm takin'. I swear, the pharmacy gave me the wrong bottle last time... or was it the other way 'round? Oh dear...

My urine, it looks like ink! Black as coal, it is. And my skin... well, I've been eatin' a lot of cheese lately, maybe that's it? Yellow's just a natural color for cheese, ain't it?

Now, where was I? Ah yes, stomach pain. Oh boy, it's a doozy. Right here (taps belly). Sometimes it's sharp, other times it feels like someone's got a fist in my gut. Like when I tried that new sausage at the diner... you know, the one with the peppers?

That's all, Doc. (pauses) Unless... unless there was something else? No, no, just get some rest and drink plenty of water, that's what my daughter says."

The burnt kind.

And then there's the pain in my stomach... or is it my back? (pauses) You know, sometimes I think it's just old age creeping up on me. All these aches and pains. Must be arthritis or something.

My urine... well, it's come out a mite darker than usual. Not like coffee or nothin', but more like tea, I reckon. And my skin... it's turned this awful yellow color. Reminds me of when I was workin' in the garden and got that nasty rash from those dandelions... (chuckles) Oh dear...

Now, about this stomach pain... (hesitates) It's been botherin' me somethin' fierce. Like a knife twistin' around inside my belly. Can't even eat no breakfast without wincin'. (pauses once more) Do you think it might be that time of the month or somethin'? I'm gettin' all confused..."

That's not good, I know. *trails off* Reminds me, we're having the granddaughter over for dinner tonight, my goodness, she loves those little meatballs... Ah yes, where was I? Oh right, temperature. My head feels hot all the time, and I have a fever. I think it's been three days now, but what day is today again?... And my pee, well, it's not exactly golden anymore. More like dark tea. Just like my coffee cup when I leave it in the sink too long. *chuckles* Oh dear me... And then there's this yellow business on my skin. Like I've been eating too much lemon curd again... Which reminds me, did we use up that jar of lemon curd? I think so, but you know how those things get stuck in my head... Stomach's been acting up something awful too. Pain in the middle, like a sharp knife.","Well, doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' just terrible for weeks now. Scratchy, sick, you know? Like my throat's on fire or somethin'. And tired, oh boy, I'm so darn tired all the time. Can't even get outta bed in the mornin', (chuckles weakly) Lord have mercy... 

And weighin' less than a feather, if you can believe it! I've been eatin', too. Just not keepin' it down, is the problem. Now my urine... well, it's like coffee or somethin'. Dark as coal, that's what it looks like when I go to the bathroom. (pauses) Now, where'd I put that recipe book? Ah yes...

My skin's turned all yellowy on me too. Don't know if it's from the food, but I've been eatin' a lot of liver... just started takin' iron supplements, you see. For my knees. (confused) Knees? Yeah, the doctor said somethin' about them bein' like worn-out shoes...

Oh dear, my stomach... hurts so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe! Sharp pains in here... (taps stomach). Must've been a good 20 years since I had one of those... when was it? (laughs weakly) Ah yes, and my temperature! Lordy, been runnin' a fever like crazy! Can't sleep at night with the sweatin'... (gulps)

Anyway, that's all I can think of for now. (pauses) Do you take coffee breaks in here?"
222,Jaundice,"I've been feeling extremely scratchy, sick, and worn out. In addition, I've lost weight and have a temperature. My urine is dark, and my skin has turned yellow. Additionally, I have been experiencing stomach pain.","I've been feelin', uh, extremely scratchy... you know what I mean? Like my throat's on fire. And sick. Just plain sick all the time. Losin' weight too, which isn't good for a person my age, if you know what I mean. Got a temperature, I'm pretty sure it's been a while now... might've been last week or the week before? Anyway, it's been high for days, and I just can't shake this tired feelin' off. And, oh boy, my urine... dark as coffee, it is. And have you noticed how pale my skin's gettin'? More yellow than my wife's kitchen curtains, I swear! Stomach's been achin' somethin' fierce too... now what was the date of my last check-up again?","I'm feeling just...just terrible, doc...or is it nurse? Wait, I'm not sure. Anyway, this scratchy business...it's been goin' on for weeks now. Can't shake it off, ya know? Makes me feel like I've got sandpaper in my throat. My grandkids, they're always gettin' sick with their sniffles and coughs, but I'm not kiddin' around. This is somethin' else.

And the weariness! Lord have mercy, I can barely make it outta bed some days. Can't even get the energy to watch my soap operas no more. Now, where was I? Ah yes, the weight loss...I've lost a good five pounds or so since...since last summer? Or was that winter? Hmmph! Anyway, it's just not like me.

Now, I know this sounds silly, but my urine...it's dark. Like coffee, almost black. My sister-in-law had somethin' similar, but she said it was a...a...uh, a kidney thingy. You'll know what I mean, doc. And my skin...yellow as can be! Reminds me of them old bananas in the kitchen. We used to make banana bread all the time...

Stomach pain? Oh boy, that's an understatement. It's like someone's stabbin' at me with a knife. Every mornin', it's there. I've tried some...some Beano, but no luck so far. And my temperature! 102 degrees, easy. No wonder I'm feelin' like this.

Where did I put that thermometer? Nowhere to be found...oh well!"
223,Jaundice,"I've been constantly feeling scratchy, sick, and tired out. In addition, I've lost weight and have a temperature. My urine is dark, and my skin has turned yellow. Furthermore, I have been experiencing stomach pain.","""I'm so... tired all the time, doctor. Can't seem to shake this scratchy feeling in my throat and chest. Been feelin' sick to my stomach, you know? I've lost weight, which is just awful. Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, temperature's been up too. 98 point... uh... something, always seems like it's a little off. My urine's dark, like coffee or somethin', and my skin... well, it's turned yellow, like old bananas. Don't know why that is. Stomach's been achin' something fierce, can't eat nothin'. We had the best roast chicken at church potluck last Sunday... anyway, stomach pain's been constant. Can't seem to shake this feelin'... ugh.""","I've been feelin' just awful, doctor... Scratchy throat, like I got a bunch of dust in there. And this tiredness, Lord have mercy... Can't seem to catch my breath. You know what I was thinkin'? My sister Edna used to make me these wonderful tea cookies when I was young. We'd have us a little get-together and she'd say ""Buddy, try one of these!"" Mmm... anyway...

Lost some weight, too. Must be all this cold weather. Yeah, cold's got me down. Don't know if it's the same thing, but my sister-in-law's friend had that hepatitis thingy last year... Wasn't she from around here? Oh, right! Got a fever, I think. Temperature's always up and down, like my grandkids when they're feelin' sick.

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My urine. It looks all darkish in the morning light. You know, just like that old tea I had last week... Wasn't it Earl Grey? Got a bit of that there lemon flavor... Hmm... What was I sayin'? Oh right! Urine. Yeah, my skin's gone all yellowy too. Not like when I used to work in the garden; I'd get these lovely sunburns. Used to make Edna laugh.

Oh dear, and this stomach pain. Can't seem to eat nothin'. Reminds me of that time we had that Thanksgiving dinner at cousin Joe's... Now, what happened with him? He had some sorta problem with his stomach... Or was it the other way 'round? Oh well...

Anyway, doctor... This all seems kinda related, don't you think?"
224,Jaundice,"I've felt really scratchy, nauseated, and worn out. I also had a high fever and lost weight. Both my skin and my urine have become yellow. I've also been experiencing stomach pain.","""Ah, doc... I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... but I've been feelin' so scratchy, ya know? Like my throat's on fire and my skin's all prickly. And nauseated, too... I think it started about two weeks ago? Or was it three? Uh, doesn't matter now. Anyway, the fever's been high, really high, and I just can't seem to shake it off. Lost some weight, too, which is no surprise since I've been eatin' like a bird lately... remember when I used to have that big ol' chicken dinner at Edna's? Mmm... anyway... my skin and urine, they're both turnin' yellow now. Can't say what it means, but don't like it one bit. And then there's this stomach pain... achy and sore all the time...""","I don't know if I'm getting old or what... (chuckles) You know, my sister used to make me these wonderful chicken soup when I was young... Anyway... So, I've been feeling really scratchy, you know? Like someone took a sandpaper to my throat. And nauseated. Ugh, it's just like being on the boat ride again, remember that one we went on, dear? (pauses) Oh yes, where's my keys?

Oh, sorry about this... So, I had a high fever, must have been 102 or so. And I lost some weight, can't believe it myself. My skin and urine are all yellow now too. I don't know if that's what they call jaundice? (hesitates) Or is that just for livers? Anyway, my skin's got this weird... y'know how your skin looks like when you're getting a sunburn but not quite? Yeah, it's something like that.

And stomach pain. Oh boy, I thought I was going to pass out from the cramps. Reminded me of those awful flu shots we used to get as kids. (laughs) Do they still do those nowdays? You know, for all our vaccinations and stuff... Now, where did I put my teeth?"
225,Jaundice,"I have been having severe itching, vomiting, and fatigue. I have also lost weight and have a high fever. My skin has turned yellow and my urine is dark. I am also experiencing abdominal pain.","I've been feelin' just awful, Doc... had this itching all over my body, can't even sleep at night from it. And then I started vomitin', ya know? My stomach just wouldn't settle down. I've lost weight, too... my clothes are gettin' looser, but not in a good way, if you know what I mean. (chuckles) Anyway... the fever's been high, must be over 100 degrees, I think. Or is that the other way around? My skin's turned this awful yellow color... like when I got that liver problem a few years ago, but my doctor at the time said it was just gallstones... (pauses) Ah yes, and my urine... well, it's dark as coffee. And in between all these things, my stomach hurts somethin' fierce... sharp pains, ya know?","I don't know if I'm gettin' this right... but, um, yeah. So, my skin's been lookin' like a, uh, lemon, you know? The color's changed and it's all yellowy. And my pee's turned dark, which is strange 'cause I've always had clear pee... or at least, as far back as I can remember. (pauses) Wait, was that the year we went to Florida? No, no, that wasn't it...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms! So, I've been feelin' like I've been hit by a truck, ya know? Fatigue, I think they call it. And my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Abdominal pain, that's what the books say, but I just call it... (pauses again) Oh dearie me! Did I ever tell you about the time I was at the beach and saw a dolphin? Such a funny little creature...

Oh right, my symptoms! (chuckles) As I was sayin', my stomach. It's been achin' somethin' terrible. And I've been losin' weight, too... which, between you and me, is a good thing since I could stand to lose a few pounds, but not like this! No sirree. (laughs nervously) Vomiting, that's what they call it. Don't know how else to say it. And high fever... which makes me think of the time I had the flu and my cousin came over with some chicken soup...

Oh dear, where's my thoughts? (pauses once more) Itching! That's another one. Severe itching all over. Can't sleep because of it. So, uh... I guess that's about it for now."

Additionally, I get stomach pain.","""I've been feelin' really scratchy, dizzy, and just plain worn out. My energy's been...

I've lost some weight since my birthday... or was that Christmas? Anyway, I don't feel as hungry as usual, if you know what I mean. And then there's this temperature thingy... (hesitates) Fever, they call it, I think? My urine is dark, and my skin has turned a bit yellowish. Some of the pills I take might be causin' that, but I'm not sure. Stomach pain too, like a cramp... or is that what they're called?""","I've been feelin' real scratchy, dizzy, and just plain worn out, you know? (pauses) Did I turn off my stove this morning? I could swear I turned it off... (chuckles) Oh dear, anyway...

So, like I was sayin', I've lost some weight. My clothes are hangin' on me somethin' awful. And I have a temperature, yes indeed. It's been 102 for three days now. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, let me think... what else? Ah yes, my urine! It's as dark as the coffee at the diner down the street. I swear it's like that every morning now.

And don't even get me started on my skin. It's turned yellow, just like a caution sign. (laughs nervously) You know, when I was a young thing, we used to play in the fields all day... anyway...

Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! My stomach! It hurts somethin' fierce. Like someone took a knife and stabbed me right through my gut. ( winces) I just can't seem to eat nothin' nowadays. Just... (pauses, lost in thought)

I think that's it, though. All the symptoms, I mean. (pauses again) Now, what was for dinner last night? My grandkids came over, and we had... uh... spaghetti! No, wait, was it chicken soup?..."
227,Jaundice,"I've been experiencing intense itchiness, nausea, and exhaustion. I also had a high fever and lost weight. Both my skin and my urine have become yellow. Additionally, my stomach hurts.","You know, doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' just awful lately. My skin's all... (taps arm) itchy, like ants crawlin'. And don't even get me started on my stomach, it's been hurtin' somethin' fierce. High fever, I'm sure of that... or was it a low one? Hmm, can't keep track no more. (chuckles) Anyway, I've lost some weight, which is probably good, I guess, but it feels like I'm just shrinkin' away. My urine's turned yellow, like my old kitchen tea. And this exhaustion... (sighs) Lord have mercy, I just want to curl up and sleep for a week. Now, where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes! I was makin' those lovely chicken pot pies... (trails off)","I've been feelin', uh, really itchy, ya know? Like my skin is crawlin' somethin' fierce. And nausea, oh boy... I mean, I think it started when I ate that chicken last week... or was it the fish? No, wait, I'm sure it was the chicken. Anyway, after lunch, I just felt queasy all of a sudden. And I've been so tired, too. Can't seem to get outta bed some days.

And my fever, dear Lord... it's like I got the flu or somethin'. Been runnin' it for days now. Don't know what's wrong with me. Used to be I'd just take some aspirin and I'd be good as new, but this time... (pauses) Oh, speaking of aspirin, I saw my cousin on TV last night talkin' about the effects of too much ibuprofen. Real interesting stuff.

But where was I? Ah yes, the fever. And then there's this weight loss business. I swear, I've lost pounds just since... uh, how long ago did I have lunch? (chuckles) Anyhow, my clothes feel loose on me now. Not that it matters at my age, but still...

My urine, well... it's turnin' yellow on me, just like my teeth used to when I didn't floss regular. And stomach hurts somethin' awful. Don't know what could be causin' all these symptoms. Must have eaten too much at the church supper last week... (sighs) What was the topic again? Oh yes, my health. Can't seem to get a straight thought out..."
228,Jaundice,"Extreme itchiness, nausea, and exhaustion have been bothering me. In addition, I developed a fever and lost weight. My pee is black, and I've developed a yellow rash.

(chuckles) Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all muddled! Anyway, I lost some weight too. Not that I'm complainin', but... (laughs)

Now, about this pee... it's just black as coal, you see? And on top of that, I got this yellow rash... or is it a rash? (pauses) Oh, bother! It's on my arm, if that means anything. And in the middle of all this... my stomach just feels like it's twistin' somethin' fierce.""","I don't know what's goin' on with me... (sigh) Okay, I'll try my best. This itchiness, it's like ants crawlin' all over my skin, can't stop scratchin', especially at night. My arms and legs, they're the worst, but even my back gets in on the action, if you know what I mean. And then there's this nausea... Ugh, it's like a big ol' knot in my stomach. Can't eat nothin', not even a piece of toast. (pauses) Did I tell you about my garden? My tomatoes are doin' real well this year...

Now where was I? Ah yes, the fever. It's been comin' and goin' for weeks now. One day it's here, next day it's gone. Don't know what that's all about. (chuckles) And my weight... Lord have mercy, I've lost so much of it! My clothes are hangin' off me like a sack. Can't even remember when was the last time I had a good meal... (starts to ramble) You know, I used to make the best chicken soup this side of the Mississippi...

Uh-oh, and don't even get me started on my pee. It's as black as coal! Must be all these vegetables I've been eatin'. (laughs nervously) Or is it that one time I ate too much beets...? Can't quite remember now. Anyway, it's this yellow rash on my arms, too. Looks like some sort of poison ivy or somethin'. (trails off) My stomach ache... Shoot, what was the question again? Ah yes! The ache in my stomach... It feels like I've been punched right in the gut. (sighs heavily) Can you give me a hand with this one, doc?"

Can't sleep at night, scratchin' all over. And the nausea, oh boy... makes me want to run to the bathroom every five minutes. Fatigue too, feel like I'm 80 years old already! You know who was like that? My grandma, she'd get these spells where she just wouldn't do nothin'. Fever's been comin' and goin', hard to keep track... I think it started last week? Or was it two weeks ago? Oh dear, weight loss is a problem too. Ugh, my pee's turned black, like coffee or somethin'... and this rash on my legs, yellow as can be.

My itchiness, you see, it's been going on for weeks now, and not just my skin, mind you, but everywhere. Can't stop scratching, it's like my poor old body is infested with mosquitoes or something... *pauses*

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the nausea. It's quite severe, I'm afraid. I mean, I've been feeling queasy since breakfast, and that was... uh... when was it again? Wednesday? No, no, Thursday! And the fatigue, oh my goodness, I feel like I've been run over by a bus. Can't even get out of bed without needing to take a nap... *yawns*

Fever's been going on for days now, and I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. And losing weight, well... that's just a given at my age, isn't it? *chuckles* But this black pee business, now that's new. I mean, I've had dark coffee before, but this is something else entirely... *giggles*

And then there's the rash. Yellow and blotchy, quite unsightly, if you ask me. Not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it'll come out in the wash, so to speak... *trails off* Oh dear, where did I put my reading glasses? Ah yes! The stomach ache. Been having some trouble with that lately too... *mutters under breath* Something about tomatoes and beans..."
230,Jaundice,I have been feeling itchy and have been vomiting. I am also very tired and have lost weight. My fever is high and my skin has become yellow. I have been experiencing abdominal pain as well.,"Dear... doctor... (pauses) I'm so glad you're here. You know, I was just talking to my sister Margaret - no, wait, is that Edna? (chuckles) Anyway, she said something about me needing to see someone... (trails off)

Oh dear, I've been feeling itchy all over - elbows, knees, everywhere! It's like ants crawling under my skin. And then there's the vomiting. (pauses) Yesterday was a bad day, or was it the day before? (laughs) Ah, never mind.

I'm just so tired... (sighs) I have no energy for anything. Lost weight too... (pauses to collect thoughts) I've been eating less, I think. Or maybe not eating at all? (looks confused)

Fever's been high... my temperature must be up in the 102s, don't you think? And this yellow business - skin turning yellow, it is. Scary! Abdominal pain too... hurts right here (taps stomach). Now I'm worried about that time we went to Hawaii with the church group... was it '97 or '98?","I'm so glad I came in today, doctor... or is it Tuesday? Wait, no, I think it's Wednesday. Ah yes, anyway. I've been feeling just dreadful lately. Itchy all over, you know? Like ants are crawling under my skin. Can't sleep at night from it. I tried using some calamine lotion, but it only seemed to make it worse. And the vomiting... oh dear lord, it's like my stomach is trying to turn itself inside out.

I'm just so tired all the time, too. Like a big ol' heavy cloud is following me everywhere. I swear, I've been sleeping 10 hours a day and still waking up feeling like I've been run over by a truck. And this weight loss... well, let's just say my pants are getting looser than a loose thread on an old sweater.

Now, about that fever... (pauses) You know, my cousin had the flu once and she said it was so bad she could see her breath in the winter. I'm pretty sure mine is higher than that. I've been taking acetaminophen, but it only seems to knock it down a little bit. And this yellow business... well, I just figured it was from eating too much corn on the cob.

Abdominal pain... yeah, that's right. It's like someone has their hand in my belly and is twisting it around like a wringer on a washing machine. I try to eat bland foods, but even that seems to make it worse. Oh dear me, what was I saying? Ah yes, the pain..."
231,Jaundice,"I've been itchy and have been throwing up. Along with losing weight, I'm also really exhausted. My skin has turned yellow, and my fever is high. My stomach has also been hurting recently.","Doc, I've been feelin' just awful lately... Itchin', you see, all over my body. My skin's gettin' all prickly, like when I used to help with the gardenin' in my youth... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the name of that flower again? You know, the one that grows on tall stalks? Ah, yes, sunflowers! Anyway...

I've also been throwin' up quite a bit. Just can't keep nothin' down, it seems. And I'm gettin' so... so thin. My clothes are all baggy now, just like my husband's used to wear. (chuckles) He was a skinny fella, always had trouble findin' pants that fit.

I'm exhausted all the time, too. Don't know how I'm supposed to keep up with all these doctor's appointments... (pauses, looks around) Where did I put my purse? Ah yes...

My skin's turned yellow, like a duck's feathers or somethin'. And my fever's been through the roof! Just can't seem to get comfortable, always feelin' hot and cold at the same time. Stomach's been killin' me, too... hurtin', I mean. Not just a little discomfort, but a full-on ache.","I don't know what's going on with me... I mean, have you seen that new show on TV? It's about those young folks solving mysteries... anyway... (pauses) I've been itchin' somethin' fierce, like my skin's crawlin' or nothin'. Can't sleep at night from it. And then there's the... uh... what was it called again? Oh yes! The vomiting. That's a new one for me. Used to be just a little stomachache after eatin', but now... well, let's just say I'm afraid to drink water. My sister said she saw this documentary about some sort of virus... couldn't remember the name... (chuckles) Oh boy, my mind's as slippery as a snake's hind legs nowadays!

Now, where was I? Ah yes! Weight loss. I swear, I've lost five pounds in two weeks. Five! Can you imagine if everyone on this block did that? We'd have to get new scales for the whole neighborhood... (laughs) Oh dear me, what am I talkin' about?

This exhaustion's got me beat, though. Just goin' from my bed to the kitchen takes more energy than it used to. My husband says I'm sleepwalkin', but I don't remember nothin' after gettin' into bed... unless I had one of those nightmares... You know what they say about memories during those dreams? Must be true, 'cause I still wake up feelin' scared...

My skin's turned yellow, like a big ol' banana. And my fever... (pauses, looks around) Shoot! What was that other thing I wanted to tell ya? Oh yes! The stomach pain. It's not just the vomiting; it hurts all day, even when I'm not throwin' up. (chuckles) Don't know why, but them commercials for the new anti-acid medication always come on when my stomach's actin' up... Must be a coincidence, right?"
232,Jaundice,"I've had a scratchy stomach and been throwing up. I have also lost weight and am really exhausted. I have a high fever and yellow skin. As well as you, I have been having stomach pain.","I've had this scratchy stomach business goin' on for... well, I'm not exactly sure how long now. My granddaughter said it was last week? Or was that when we were at my sister's house for dinner? Anyway, ever since then, I've been feelin' like I want to vomit somethin' fierce. Losin' weight too, which is a worry... always worried about me bein' too thin, if you know what I mean. (pauses) Oh, and the fever! Lord have mercy, it's been a doozy. This yellow skin business is a new one for me, though. Always had a bit of a jaundice when I was younger... but that was from eatin' too many liver pies, I'm pretty sure. (chuckles) Ah, stomach pain, yes... just like you said, it's been killin' me.","I don't know if this is what it's called... but my stomach's been scratchy, you see. Like when you're eating too much of that wheat bread and your belly gets all achy. And then I've been throwing up, which isn't good, I'm sure. I mean, I used to be able to eat a whole plate of chicken parmesan without... uh... anyway. Weight loss, I guess is what they call it? Yeah, that's happening too.

Exhausted, dear me. Just so tired all the time. My sister used to have something similar, but she said it was just menopause or some such nonsense. Don't know if that applies here, though... Do you take any notes like I do with my hearing aid? Can be quite a bother, having to replace batteries and whatnot...

Now, this is the worst part: fever. Oh my goodness, it's through the roof! Yellow skin, you see. Like when I used to be out in that awful garden all day as a child... but no, not like that at all. Must have gotten some kind of bug from someone... (gasp) or maybe just eaten too much bad fish...

And this stomach pain... well, it's been going on and off, ever since... hmm, I think it started after I had that peculiar dream last night. About falling down the stairs? No, no, not that one. It was something else entirely... What were we talking about again?"

My stomach has also been hurting.,"""Doc, I'm so glad I could make it in today... (pauses) Oh, what was I supposed to do at 2 o'clock this afternoon? Ah yes, bingo night!

Lost some weight, too, can tell by the way these clothes are hangin' off me. (pauses) Now where did I put those glasses? Ah yes! Exhaustion, that's what they call it, right? Can't even walk to the kitchen without gettin' winded. Skin's turned all yellow like a banana... (gulps) And my fever's been through the roof, if you know what I mean.

Anyway, like I said, itchin's been pretty bad. And then there's the throwin' up... Oh boy, it's like my stomach's tryin' to turn itself inside out. (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, the weight loss... I've lost a good 10 pounds or so in the last few weeks. It's like all my appetite just went away. And don't even get me started on bein' tired... (yawns) Excuse me.

Now, about this yellow business... My skin's taken on this funny hue, like butter or somethin'. (chuckles nervously) I remember when my sister had jaundice as a kid... Wasn't it because of them medicine tablets she took? Or was it the food? Ah, oh well. And then there's the fever... Lord have mercy, it's been ridin' me hard like a wild mustang! (laughs)

Oh, and I almost forgot about my stomach. It hurts somethin' fierce. Like someone's pokin' a stick in it all day long. (pauses) Now, what was I talkin' 'bout again?"
234,Jaundice,"I've been exhausted and experiencing nausea and itching. In addition, I've lost weight and have a temperature. My urine is dark, and my skin has turned yellow. Additionally, I've been having stomach pain.","Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes... Doc says I'm tired all the time, feel like I've been runnin' a marathon without even gettin' off the couch. Nausea too, y'know? Makes me think of that time I went to the lake house with the family, my cousin's kid got food poisoning from those bad hot dogs... anyway, where was I? Ah yes, itchin' too, all over, like a rash or somethin'. Lost some weight, haven't been eatin' much since... hmm, what was it, last week? No, no, that can't be right... Anyway, fever's been up and down. My urine's turned this dark brown color, like tea or somethin', and my skin's all yellowy. Stomach's been hurtin' too, crampy pains... (pauses) Oh, I'm gettin' so forgetful these days!","I'm so glad you're here to see me again, dear... I've been feeling just terrible lately. Exhausted, that's the word. Can't seem to get out of bed in the morning no matter how hard I try. And this nausea... oh my goodness, it's like a storm inside me. Makes me feel like I'm going to be sick all the time.

You know what? I had a lovely cup of tea this morning with some sugar and cream. Reminded me of when your mother used to make them for us... anyway... yes, the nausea. It's been getting worse every day. And these itchy sensations on my skin... I don't like that one bit.

Now, let me think... what was it I wanted to tell you? Ah yes! My weight loss. I've lost so much weight in just a few weeks. I looked at myself in the mirror and thought, ""Good heavens, who's this old person?"" (chuckles) But seriously, I'm worried about my health.

And then there's this fever... it comes and goes, but it's always there, lurking. I've had it for what feels like an eternity now. Oh dear, where did I put that letter from the doctor I saw last week? Ah yes! (rummages through papers) My urine... it's been dark as coal, like my husband used to make those lovely stews with... (stops abruptly)

I'm sorry, what was I saying? Ah yes, my skin. It's turned yellow, you see. Not that I mind a little bit of color, but this is quite... unusual. And then there's the stomach pain. Oh dear me, it's like someone's taken a knife to my insides.

Now, have you got a minute for some tea? I think I left the pot on in the kitchen..."
235,Jaundice,"I have been suffering from itching, vomiting, and fatigue. I have also lost weight and have a high fever. My skin has turned yellow and my urine is dark. I have also been experiencing abdominal pain","I've had this itching for... um... well, I think it started about a week ago? Or was it two weeks? Anyway, my skin gets all red and itchy, especially on my arms and legs. And then there's been this vomiting. Oh dear, I remember that one time I had to go to the hospital, oh what's his name... Dr. Smith? No, wait, it was Johnson... Anyway, they gave me some pills for my stomach.

I'm so tired all the time, too weak to even walk to the mailbox. My appetite's gone and I've lost weight. And this fever, it just won't go away. Last night I had a 103-degree fever, I think that's what they called it? I don't know why these young doctors use such big numbers... My skin's turned yellow, like butter. And the urine, dear Lord, it's as dark as coffee.

My belly hurts too. All the time. It's hard to describe, but it feels like there's a knot inside me.","I've had this... this thing, you know? For weeks now. Itching all over my body, especially on my back and arms. Makes me want to scratch and scratch till I'm raw. Vomiting too. Can't eat nothin' without gettin' sick again. Fatigue, yeah that's a big one. Can barely make it outta bed in the mornin'. Lost some weight too... not that I mind losin' a few pounds, but this is different. Fever's been up and down like a rollercoaster. Can't remember when I last had a good night's sleep.

Skin looks like I'm turnin' into a banana or somethin', all yellowy. My wife says it's from too much cheese... (chuckles) Ah, yeah, probably that. And the urine, dear Lord... it's like coffee or somethin'. Dark as can be. I've been makin' myself go every hour or so, but it just won't come out right. Abdominal pain, yeah that's a doozy too. Feels like someone's got a knife stuck in me side. (pauses) Oh, speakin' of knives... my nephew used to have one just like this when he was a kid...

And the itching... I swear it's gettin' worse at night. Can't even relax in bed without thinkin' about scratchin'. My mind's all over the place these days... (sighs) Oh, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, the symptoms. Well, that's pretty much it. That's what I'm dealin' with now."
236,Jaundice,"I've been feeling scratchy, sick, and worn out. I also had a high fever and lost weight. Both my skin and my urine have become yellow. Additional stomach pain that I've been having","Oh dear, doctor... I don't know what's gotten into me lately. Scratchy, that's the word... sick and worn out, like I've been running around in circles all day. (pauses) You know, reminds me of when my cousin Edna had the flu back in '52. She was a mess, just like me now. Fever's been high, must've been over 100 degrees at its peak... can't rightly remember. Lost some weight too, which I'm sure is just fine considering I've been trying to eat less sugar. (chuckles) Now my skin and urine, they're both turned yellow. Like old lemonade, you know? And my stomach's been killing me. Stomach pain, that's what I get... (trails off) What was the date again today?","I don't know if you remember me telling you about my cousin Edna... anyway... I've been feeling real poorly lately. Scratchy all over, like I got sandpaper in my throat or something. Sick to my stomach too. Just worn out, ya know? Can't do nothin' without gettin' tired. My grandkids say I'm always noddin' off at the dinner table... (chuckles) Oh dear...

Now, about this fever I've been havin'. It's been there for a few days now. Lord have mercy, it's high! Must be over 100, I reckon. Losin' weight too... just can't seem to keep nothin' down. Food, water... everything tastes funny. (pauses) You know what was funny? When I used to take them kids on picnics by the lake... we'd have these huge sandwiches and they'd all get eaten up in one go... (chuckles)

Now where was I? Ah yes! Yellow skin. My arms, my face... even my fingers are turnin' yellow. And don't even get me started on my urine! It's as yellow as a banana peel! I'm startin' to feel like I've got some kind of... I don't know what it is, but somethin's goin' on inside me, that's for sure.

And this stomach pain! Shoot, doc... (sighs) I just can't explain it. Been havin' these cramps and aches for weeks now. Can't remember when they started, to be honest... was it last winter? No, no... must've been spring... or was it fall? (trails off)

Oh dear me! I'm so sorry, doc. Gettin' all sidetracked on you. Just tell me what's wrong with me and how to make it stop, would ya?"
237,Jaundice,"The itch, the nausea, and the weariness have been bothering me. In addition, I developed a fever and lost weight. My pee is black, and I've developed a yellow rash. Additionally, I've had stomach ache.","""Doctor... uh... the itch, you see, it started on my legs first, I think. Or was it my arms? Oh dear, I always get those mixed up. Anyway, it spreads like wildfire, if you know what I mean. Then this nausea came along, and don't even get me started on the weariness. I'm exhausted all the time, can't even remember to take my pills... (chuckles) ...my grandkids tell me that's a bad sign.

Fever, yes, fever. Been feeling it for days now. Lost weight too, which is no good at my age. I was trying to eat more, you know? My mother used to say... uh... what was the word she used? Oh yes! Eat to live, not live to eat. (giggles) Now my pee's all black, and I got this yellow rash on my elbows. And stomach ache, oh dear lord, it hurts like my old hip joint.

When did I start feeling like this, now that you ask? Let me see... was it last week? Or the week before? Oh dear, time flies when you're having fun... (trails off) Ah yes, anyway...""","I'm gettin' these... (pauses) ...itches all over my body, doc. Can't sleep at night 'cause of the itch, you see. And then there's this... (hesitates) nausea business. Losin' weight like crazy, don't know what I did with that apple pie from last week... or was it the cookies? Hmm... anyway. My stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce too. Stomach ache, you know?

Now, this fever thingy... (pauses to think) started a while back, I reckon. Don't rightly remember when it began. Could've been Monday or Tuesday... or was that last week? Oh dear, I'm all mixed up! (chuckles)

Oh, and the urine! It's like coffee grounds in my cup, I kid you not! Black as coal, if I may say so myself. Doc, can you explain why it's like that? Is it somethin' to do with... with what we had for dinner last night? I don't remember eatin' any beets or rhubarb...

Now, this rash – yellow as a banana peel! (excitedly) I think it started on my arm, but now it's all over. Like it's spreadin', just like that time when... when we went to the beach and I got sunburned somethin' awful!

You know what? I remember I used to take these pills for my blood pressure... (pauses) was it aspirin or was it... (trails off)

Anyway, doc, you see I'm gettin' all these symptoms at once. What do you think it is? Can you help me figure this out?"
238,Jaundice,"I have been experiencing intense itching, vomiting, and fatigue. I have also lost weight and have a high fever. My skin has turned yellow and my urine is dark.

This itching, oh boy, it's like ants crawling all over my skin. I woke up last night with the worst itch on my arm, right here (taps arm). Vomiting too, can't seem to keep nothin' down. Fatigue, you know? Just want to sit in a chair and stare at the wall. Lost some weight, don't ask me how much, but it's noticeable. Fever, I think it's been three days now... or is that four? Oh dear, my mind's gettin' all muddled. (chuckles) Skin's turned yellow, like bananas, I swear. And this dark urine business... I don't know what's goin' on with me. Abdominal pain too... I've had some of those stomach issues before, but not like this.","Oh boy, doc... (pauses) I don't know if I've got all my thoughts straightened out... but anyway... you see, I wake up at night and my skin feels like it's on fire, itching something fierce. Vomiting, too... can't keep nothin' down. (chuckles) Like that one time we went to the county fair... I had a big ol' turkey leg and I got sick right after eatin'. (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, vomiting. It's been goin' on for weeks now.

I'm tired all the time, like my batteries are runnin' down or somethin'. Weight loss... I reckon that's a given when you can't eat nothin', but still. (pauses) My sister used to say, ""Eat more sugar, it'll give you energy."" No idea if that's true... but anyway...

High fever, too... like when I got the flu back in '72. We didn't have all these fancy medicines then... just had to ride it out. Now I'm not so sure about my memory no more... what was I talkin' about? Ah yes! My skin, it's turned a funny shade of yellow... and (pauses) uh, the color of this one flower that grows by the lake, you know? Not exactly the same, but... (chuckles) anyway...

Urine's dark like coffee... which reminds me, I gotta get more coffee grounds for my son-in-law. He makes a fine cuppa joe. Abdominal pain... now that I can remember without thinkin' about nothin' else! My stomach feels like it's been punched by Joe Louis hisself... or maybe it's just the beans... I don't know."

Oh yes, I've got a temperature, can't keep track of how high it's been, but I'm sure it's too high. My urine's all dark now, like coffee or something... and don't even get me started on my skin. It's turned yellow, just like when I used to eat too much turmeric for my arthritis... Stomach's been achin' somethin' fierce, too.""","I don't know if it's the weather, but I've been feeling... scratchy... you know? And sick, yes, that's the word. Sick. Worn out too. Like I've got no energy at all. (pauses) Wait, where was I going this morning? Oh dear, I had to go get some eggs from the store...

(rambles) Anyway, weight loss... oh my goodness, I used to be a size 12! Now I'm down to an 8. What's happening to me? (chuckles nervously) My family says I look like I've lost too much weight already. I don't know... (trails off)

My temperature's always up, can't seem to get it down. I think it's been days now... weeks maybe? And my urine, dear lord, it's like coffee or something! Dark as coal. Can't be good for you, right? (pauses) You remember when I used to work at the factory? We had this big machine that produced all sorts of things, but it was always so hot and humid in there...

(muttering to self) Where did I put my keys? Ah yes! My stomach... (sighs) Oh boy, it's been hurting something awful. Stomach pain, I think is the phrase you're looking for. Yes, that's right. Stomach pain... and my skin... (squints eyes) Is it yellow or am I just getting old? Can't be good if it's yellow, no sirree...

(rambles some more) You know what we had for dinner last night? My grandkids came over and made spaghetti with me. We used to make it all the time when their mother was alive... (gets choked up) Excuse me, just a little something in my throat..."

Anyway, I've been feelin' like I'm carryin' around a big ol' weightless rock inside me.

Now, my skin's turned yellow as can be, and so has my pee. High fever's been with me for days, maybe even... hmm, was that last Wednesday we went to the Early Bird Special? Oh dear, anyway... and I've got this stomach crampin', feels like someone's twistin' a big ol' wrench in there. Stomach's just been a-killin' me...","I don't know if it's the weather... always makes my joints ache... (pauses) But anyway, I've been feeling... scratchy, yes, scratchy, all over.

Not even my favorite cookies no more. And the fever... (hesitates) Now what was it I used to get when I had that fever? Ah yes, my great-aunt Mildred, she always said... anyway...

I've been goin' to the bathroom a lot and, uh, well, let's just say my urine's got some color to it. Yellow, that's right. Like lemonade on a summer day. (chuckles) Now, I remember when we used to make lemonade with real lemons... My granddaughter would always get juice all over her face... (trails off)

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, my stomach. It hurts. Always does after them beans at the church potluck. But this time... feels different. More like a burnin' or something. Can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's just that new medication... Dr. Jenkins said it might cause some side effects, but I didn't think... (stammers)

Anyway, high fever and all, I'm gettin' a bit worried. And this yellowness... like when you eat too much turmeric or somethin'. You know how your mom used to make that big ol' curry for Thanksgiving? Always made the whole house smell funny... (stops suddenly) Wait, what were we talkin' about again?"

Whiskers, that's her name. Lovely creature...

Now where was I? Ah yes, the yellow skin and dark urine... it's just so worrying. And this pain in my abdomen, doc... or Karen... (laughs) Sorry, what was the question again?","Um, doc... I think I've been feeling pretty crummy lately. Yeah, severe itching all over my body. Can't even scratch my arm without getting a rash. And then there's this vomiting business. Can't seem to keep anything down. Water, food, nothing's staying in. (pauses) You know, my late husband used to love chicken soup when he was sick. I should make some for myself... no, wait, that won't help.

I've also been feeling really tired. Fatigue, is it called? Yeah, that's the word. My legs ache just from getting out of bed in the morning. And my weight! Oh dear lord, I must have lost 10 pounds since last month. (chuckles) My sister said she couldn't even recognize me at our family reunion.

Now, this yellow business... I think it started a few weeks ago? Maybe with some antibiotics? Or was that for something else? Hmm... Anyway, my skin's turned quite the shade of banana, if you know what I mean. (giggles) And don't even get me started on my urine! It's as dark as coffee, just like my brother-in-law's favorite brew.

But what really hurts is this... (taps stomach) Abdominal pain, they call it? Ache, cramp, or just plain old misery. That's what I feel every time I try to eat something. Or even think about eating... No, no, I'm getting ahead of myself. I was saying that my fever's quite high too. Must be over a hundred, if not more.

My urine's like coffee, dark as coal. And my skin, well, it's turned yellow, ain't it? Like I've got one of those fancy mustard stains on my shirt. You know what I'm thinkin' about? My cousin Edna's cat, Snowball... she had the most beautiful white coat...

Ooh, and stomach pain! That's another thing. It's like someone's stabbin' me with a knife every time I eat. (pauses) Now where did I put my teeth? Ah yes, here they are. Anyway... temperature. Oh dear, I think I might have gotten a fever. Should've taken it myself... you know how I always do that."

Fever's been awful high, Doctor said something about... (pauses, trying to remember) Ah yes! 104 degrees or something like that? Don't rightly know how it got so high. Wasn't too good for my skin either... turned yellow, just like a big ol' banana peel... or was it an apple?

Urine's been dark as coal, just... (hesitates) Can't put my finger on what's causing all this. Maybe that new medicine I'm taking? Or the food at the cafeteria here at the nursing home? Always think they're skimping on the salt... or is it sugar? (trails off)

I've also been feelin' so tired all the time. Just can't seem to muster up any energy for nothin'. My skin's turned this awful yellow color... like lemonade or somethin'. And the itching! Lord have mercy, it's drivin' me crazy! I scratch and scratch but it just won't stop. (pauses once more) Now, wasn't I supposed to pick up some milk on my way here? (laughs)

Fever's been plaguin' me too... 102 degrees, at least. My wife says it's like the flu or somethin', but I don't know... (confused) We used to have that one relative who always got sick with the flu... Uncle Joe, was it? No, no... his name was Eddie. Wait, what was I sayin'? Oh right! Dark urine. That's new. Never seen my pee look like that before. And this stomach pain... (pauses again) Now, did I turn off the stove at home? I swear I turned it off..."

My fever's been ragin', must've taken my temperature three times this mornin'. I'm talkin' 103, easy. And the vomiting, well, it's a regular nightmare. Can't even keep down water no more. My stomach's all growly and I feel like I'm gonna pass out... (pauses) Did I tell you about my cousin Edna? She had a tumor or somethin', yeah...

Now, let me think... my urine's dark as coffee, that's what the nurse said, anyway. And don't even get me started on the belly pain... it's like someone's stuck a knife in there and is twistin' it around... (mumbles to self) Where did I put those aspirins? Ah yes...

Weight loss, you see... that's the problem. Can't seem to eat nothin'. Just feel like... just a shell of my former self. What year was it when we went to Hawaii? 1952, I think... (chuckles) Oh dear, oh dear...

Oh, and one more thing: my joints ache somethin' fierce. Like someone's beatin' on 'em with a hammer... (pauses) You know what would be nice right about now? A big ol' plate of my wife's chicken soup... or was that just last week I had it? Ah yes, anyway..."

Can't sleep at night because of it.

Fever's been high... don't know what temperature it is... but it feels like 105 degrees Fahrenheit in here... (gulps) Dark urine, that's not good, right? Stomach pain too...

(chuckles) I was just thinkin', what was I doin' yesterday? Oh yes, I went to the market... or was it the grocery store?

And then there's this vomiting business. So much so that I've lost count of how many times I've gone to the bathroom... not that I'm proud of it, no sirree. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about my grandkids? They're just the lights of my life...

But anyway, my skin... it's turned a lovely shade of yellow, if I do say so myself. Though I suppose that's not exactly what one wants to look like at this stage in life... (trails off) Mmm... chicken soup... did I make some yesterday?

Fever? Shoot, yes! I've been runnin' it for weeks now. And my urine... dark as coal, if you can imagine. (chuckles nervously) Oh dear me... and the pain in my stomach? Good Lord above...

I think I've been havin' some problems with my stomach. You see, after eatin', I get this acidity feelin'. Like a burnin' sensation in my chest. My wife says it's probably from all them hot dogs we had for lunch the other day. Now, where did I put my teeth? Ah yes... (pauses) Where was I? Oh right. So, after eatin', it gets worse if I lie down, you know. Like a wave of heat. My son said something about acid reflux, but what's that mean again?

Anyway, that's not the only thing. These headaches... oh boy, they're gettin' me down. Ache all over my head, like someone's tap-tap-tappin' on my skull with a hammer. And then there's these blurred visions. Can't make out nothin', it's like lookin' through a foggy window. (pauses) Now, I swear I had a nice cup of tea just yesterday... what was the flavor again? Ah yes, lemon. Maybe that'll help.

You see, I've been thinkin', maybe it's all connected to my wife's cookin'. She says she's changed her recipe, but I'm not so sure. (pauses) Oh dear, I just remembered I need to pick up some milk on the way home... or was it eggs? Ah yes, and them hot dogs... Must've been a Tuesday. Always on Tuesdays we have hot dogs.

My head just feels like it's gonna split sometimes, and then my vision gets all... foggy, you know? Like looking through a dirty windowpane. And after meals, oh boy... acid reflux, indigestion, the whole shebang. Reminds me of that time I ate that spicy taco at the church potluck...

Throbbing pain, right behind my eyes. (chuckles) Like someone's pounding away with a hammer.

Now, about this vision business... Hazy, that's the word. Can't quite put my finger on it, but things seem... fuzzy. Not like when I'm getting old and need reading glasses, no, no. More like... well, have you ever tried to watch TV at night after dinner? (pauses) Ah, yes! It's like that.

And speaking of food... (muttering to self) where did I put those aspirin? Ah yes, meals! Acid reflux, indigestion... (taps foot impatiently) You know, my wife used to make this wonderful roast chicken with... (stops suddenly) Wait a minute. Roast chicken... No, no, it was fish! We had fish one time, and I got sick as a dog! Must've been the... (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, my eyes. These past few weeks, maybe it's been longer, I'm not sure... (chuckles) I always get mixed up with days and whatnot.

Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now. (laughs) Sorry about that, doc...","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... anyway, my vision's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately.

So, I'm watchin' this program, and everything's lookin' all fuzzy-like, if you know what I mean. Like a funhouse mirror or somethin'.

Now, let me think back on when this started... Was it last week? Or was that the time I had to get my glasses adjusted again? (pauses) Ah, yes! Last week, I was walkin' down the street, and them streetlights all looked like they were wobblin' back and forth. It was quite disorientin', let me tell you.

And then there's these little... sparks, or dots, or somethin'... floatin' around my field of vision. (pauses again) I don't know if that's related or not. My sister had something like that once... wasn't it glaucoma? Or was that the thing with her eyes gettin' all watered up? (chuckles to self) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old...

Now, let me see if I can remember my medication... Ah yes! My blood pressure pills. Do they have somethin' to do with... (pauses once more) Never mind that now. So, like I was sayin', my vision's been a might strange lately. Could be a spell? Or maybe just old age catchin' up with me..."

You know, the ones that made you look like a funhouse reflection? (chuckles) Ah, those were the days... Anyway, my eyesight's been playin' tricks on me somethin' fierce. Can't read nothin' without my glasses, and even then it's hard to make out what's what. I swear, sometimes I see two of everythin', like I'm lookin' through them new-fangled 3D glasses they have at the movies...","I've been seein'... you know, things don't look right no more.

Like when you get that glass of water on the road and it looks all... (chuckles) well, you know how it looks.

But it's not just that. I see things out of the corner of my eye, too. Shadows, like. (pauses again) Now, where did I put my teeth? I could swear I left 'em on the counter... no, wait, that was last night. (laughs) Oh dear me!

Anyway... this vision business. It's been goin' on for a while now. Maybe it's from all the reading I've been doin'. (mumbles to herself) Need to get my glasses checked... or is it my contacts? No, no, I don't wear those anymore.

Now what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The distorted vision. It's like lookin' through a bunch of... of... (struggles for words) wobbly lenses, yeah! And sometimes, I see things that ain't there at all! Like, I swear I saw my late husband standin' in the kitchen the other day... or was it just a picture on the wall? (sighs)

I don't know what's goin' on with me. I just want to be able to see straight again. And walk down the street without trippin' over my own feet! (chuckles) Now that'd be somethin', wouldn't it?"

(pauses) Reminds me of that time I tried to watch the Oscars on my new TV and couldn't figure out why everyone looked like they were speaking in a different language... anyway...

I swear, just yesterday, or was it last week? (chuckles) Oh dear, it's all a bit fuzzy nowadays. Ah yes, my eyesight! I'd say I'm having trouble reading the newsprint now. And when I look out the window, everything looks... foggy. Like someone's put a veil over the whole neighborhood. Now, where did I put that recipe for my famous potato salad? (pauses) Oh, right!

You know, doc, I do get some of these... flashes, like a camera shutter going off in my head. (laughs nervously) Must be just old age catching up with me!","I'm tellin' ya, doc... or is it nurse? Hmm... (pause) Oh dear, I forgot what I was sayin'. Ah yes! My eyesight. It's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Seein' things all distorted and whatnot.

I was walkin' down the street yesterday, and I saw this big ol' tree. But it looked all wrong. The branches were stretchin' out too far, like they were tryin' to grab me. And the leaves? They were a funny color. Not green at all, more like... (pauses) Yellow! No, no, that's not right either.

Now, I know I've got cataracts or somethin', but this is different. My eyes feel all gritty and dry, like when you don't wear your contact lenses for a day. But I'm supposed to be wearin' my contacts now... (trails off)

Oh, what was the question? Ah yes! My eyesight. So, it's been goin' downhill for weeks, maybe months. And I've been gettin' these weird flashbacks. Not just any old memories, mind you. Like when I was a little girl, my grandmother used to tell me stories about... (pauses) Oh dear, what was the story called? You know, that one with the mermaids and the— 

Wait, where was I? Ah yes! My eyesight's been gettin' all wonky. Now my house is lookin' a little off too. The furniture's not where it should be... (pauses)"

As I was sayin', this hunger business... it's been goin' on for weeks now. And then there's my neck, doc... it's been stiff as a board.

No, no, I could've sworn it was Dr. Johnson last time... Ah, yes! Anyway, I've been feelin' just starvin', even after I eat a whole meal. Can't seem to get full up no more. Had roast beef and mashed potatoes for lunch today, and by the afternoon, I'm thinkin' about makin' myself some sandwiches. Sandwiches! What was I sayin'? Oh yeah, hungry all the time... (pauses) You know what my wife used to make? The best chicken soup this side of the Mississippi. She'd add in these little carrots... (trails off)

Now, where was I? Ah yes! So, I've been eatin' more than usual, but still feelin' like a bird with its feathers all ruffled. My neck's been stiff as a board since Monday. Can't turn my head without gettin' a crick in it. (chuckles) You know what they say about gettin' older: ""your body starts to turn on ya."" (pauses, lost in thought) I had the best corn on the cob at the fair last summer... mmm...

I think that's what it is – my neck's all stiff and I'm always hungry. Must be somethin' in my system, like them commercials say: ""take this pill and you'll feel better."" (laughs) Course, it's not just about feelin' better; it's about gettin' to the bottom of things... now what was it again? Ah yes! I've been hungry all the time. And that neck... stiff as a board.

You see, sometimes things look all fuzzy and distorted. Like when I was reading the newspaper this morning, the words on the page just seemed to be swimming around. (chuckles) I swear, I must have gotten some kind of eye drops or something.

And it's not just that... my vision's been acting up at night too. You know, like when you can't quite focus on what you're looking at? Yeah, it's like that. But then again, maybe I'm getting old and just need to get my reading glasses updated. (laughs) My grandkids say I always was a bit near-sighted...

Oh dear, where was I going with this? Ah yes, the distortions! They can be quite... unsettling, to put it mildly. Like when I see things moving out of the corner of my eye, but when I turn around, there's nothing there. (pauses) You know what might have triggered all this? That new TV show I started watching with my wife. It's got all these fancy effects and stuff... maybe that's playing tricks on my eyes. (trails off)

Wait, what were we talking about again? Oh right! My eyesight. I'm sure it'll sort itself out once the dust settles, like when I was a young man and used to work in construction... (chuckles) We'd get all sorts of dirt and debris in our eyes, but that just made us grumpy for a bit... (trails off again)

I mean, I was watchin' TV with my grandkids the other day, and they were playin' that new video game, and I swear I saw a blur on the screen. But then again, it might've been just the picture quality. You know how those new TVs are? Always sayin' ""4K this"" and ""HDR that""... anyway... where was I? Ah yes, my vision. It's like lookin' through a piece of fine mesh, ya know? Not too bad in the mornin', but by the afternoon it gets all wobbly-like. Now, I'm not one to complain, but I think it started about... hmmm... was it last month or the one before? Anyway, my wife says I've been gettin' a little more... ah... absent-minded, too. (pauses) Oh, speakin' of which, did you hear about Bob Jenkins? Had a heart attack, poor fella.","I don't know if I should be talking about this, but... you know how my grandkids always say I'm grumpy? Well, I've been feeling like that lately. Grumpy and gloomy. Don't get me wrong, it's not just because of the news, although... (pauses) You know who's always on TV these days? That young fella from the fire department. Always rescuing people. (chuckles) Anyway...

Now, where was I? Ah yes! My vision. It's been acting up a bit. Like when you wake up in the morning and your eyes are all... (tries to find the right word) ...foggy? Is that the word? Foggy. That's it. And then it clears up after a while, but... (pauses again)

Now I know what you're thinking: ""What's wrong with her?"" But let me tell you, I'm not just making it up! My friend Mabel had cataracts and she couldn't see anything. Not even her grandkids. Poor thing. (starts to get sidetracked) You know, I used to love taking Mabel on walks around the neighborhood... we'd walk for hours...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes! My vision! So it's been blurry at times, and sometimes when I'm looking at a picture or something, it's like trying to read a book in a swimming pool. (laughs) I know that doesn't make sense, but... you'll see what I mean if we get the glasses on. Or maybe not. (chuckles)

I'm getting old, what can I say? But seriously, doctor, I think there might be something wrong. My wife always says I'm being too hard on myself, but I know my own mind. And it's been acting up... or so I think. Sometimes I wonder if it's just the cold weather... Do you remember when we had that big snowstorm last year? (starts to reminisce) ..."

Oh, and gettin' up at night's been a problem too. Don't know if it's related or what. But it's like my body's just not listenin' when I say ""time for bed.""

Poor fella... always breakin' things... (trails off) Ah yes, my vision... been feelin' quite... blurry... (sighs)","I'm so glad you're here, doctor... I've been feeling just terrible lately. Can't seem to shake this... (pauses) what was I saying? Ah yes, depression. That's it. Been feeling mighty low, like a wet blanket's been draped over my whole self. Irritable too, can't stand hardly anyone, even the grandkids get on my nerves something awful. And then there's this thing with my vision... (pauses again) Now, where did I put that paper I was reading about? Ah yes, it was here somewhere... Oh dear, what was I saying?

Oh yes, my eyes! They're all wonky now. Can't see the clock on the wall without squinting like a... like an owl or something. (chuckles) You know how owls can see in the dark? That's exactly it! My eyes used to be fine, but now they're acting up like an old car with worn-out tires. (trails off)

You know, I had a cousin, Bertha, she was just like me – wonky eyes and all that. We'd play cards together for hours... what year is this again? 1962? No, no, that's not right... Anyway, we'd play till the wee hours of the morning, and then my sister would yell at us to get some sleep... Ah yes! Now I remember: it was 1958, a lovely summer, just like last week. (laughs)

Anyway, doctor, where were we? Ah yes, my vision! So, as I was saying, I wake up every morning feeling all foggy and can't make out the words on the TV. Maybe you could give me some... something for it? You know what that stuff is called? The eye drops? (pauses once more) What's the name of those things again?

Now, let me get this straight: I'm telling you all this because... hmm... why am I here exactly? Oh yes! My symptoms! That's right!"
109,Migraine,"I've been irritated and depressed lately, and I've also noticed a change in my vision.","I don't know if it's just me, but I've been feelin' pretty down lately... can't put my finger on it, but it's like a cloud followin' me everywhere. Irritated, that's the word. Can't concentrate on nothin', even watchin' TV is a chore. And then there's this thing with my eyes... now let me think, was it last week or the week before? Hmm... oh yes! I had lunch at Sally's, best chicken soup in town, by the way. Anyway, my vision's been actin' up. Can't focus on things like I used to. It's all blurry, you know? Like lookin' through a piece of wax paper or somethin'.","( static background noise... ) 

Oh boy, I don't know if this is all connected, but... (pause) You know what I was just thinking about? My garden. The tomatoes were doing great last year. But anyway... (clears throat)

I've been feeling rather down lately. Can't seem to shake it off. Irritated, too. Don't like the way my wife drives, if you know what I mean. (chuckles) Always getting into that new fella's car... (trails off)

Vision? Oh yes, vision! Been noticing some changes. Not just me, though. My cousin Edna had something with her eyes... was it cataracts? No, no... (pauses, confused) What was I saying?

Oh dear, my mind's all over the place today. (laughs nervously) Sorry about this, Doc. It's just... (gulps)

Anyway, these vision changes... (hesitates) Well, things look a bit fuzzy sometimes. And colors? Not as vibrant as they used to be. Now I'm thinking maybe it's because of all the time I spend watching TV at night... (winks)

I swear I had some fish sticks for dinner last night, but my wife says we had chicken... (confused chuckle) Hmm... (pauses again)

Oh yes! And have I told you about my doctor's appointment with Dr. Lee in 1992? (excitedly) He was a wonderful man... (stares off into space)

Now, what were we talking about again? (laughs awkwardly)"
110,Migraine,"Along with recurrent headaches and blurred vision, I suffer acid reflux and trouble digesting my food.","You know, doc... (pauses) ...I've been gettin' these headaches again. Not just one or two a week like I used to, but every day now. Can't even remember the last time I had a headache-free morning. And my eyesight, well... it's all blurry lately. Can't make out the TV when I'm watchin' my stories. (pauses) Did I tell you about that new show on Hallmark? My niece loves it... anyway...

Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the headaches and vision. And then there's this stomach business. Acid reflux, they call it. Heartburn, too. It's like a burnin' in my chest after meals. (pauses) Did I take that new pill you recommended? Was it for my blood pressure or...?

Now, food... well, it don't sit right with me no more. Can't digest it properly, and I get this crampy feelin'. Like when I ate them beans at the church potluck last month. (chuckles) Lord have mercy, that was a mistake...

Oh dear, what's my name again? (laughs nervously)...","I'm gettin' these headaches, dear... recurrent, I think that means they come back regular like clockwork. Don't know what causes 'em, maybe too much coffee in the mornin', you know how it is. Blurry vision, too... can't read nothin' smaller than a postcard without my glasses, which I swear I just cleaned last week... (pauses) Wait, was that last Tuesday or Wednesday? Anyway... and my eyes feel all scratchy like I got sand in 'em.

Now, let's see... other things. This acid reflux business... it's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Heartburn, indigestion... you name it. (chuckles) Reminds me of that time I ate them hot peppers at the church picnic and had to run outta there in a hurry! Lord have mercy... anyway. And food... well, some foods don't agree with me no more like they used to. Can't eat beans or cabbage without... (pauses) What was it called? Oh yes, bloating! That's what my granddaughter told me it was.

Now, let me think on this for a sec... I had the most wonderful chicken soup at the diner last week... and my stomach just... just felt like it was gonna burst. Felt terrible afterwards, too. Like my insides were doin' the cha cha slide! (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all mixed up here... anyway... I reckon that's about it for now. I'll try to remember more when I get home... if I can remember where I put my keys... (trails off)"
111,Migraine,"I have been experiencing acid reflux and difficulty digesting my food, along with regular headaches and impaired vision","I've been having this... acid reflux business, you know? Since... um... I think it was last week? Or was that two weeks ago? Oh dear, my mind is getting all muddled! Anyway, it started with these heartburn episodes after dinner. And then the food wouldn't sit right in my stomach. My grandson, Jimmy's boy, he had a similar problem when he was younger... (pauses) Oh yes, where was I? Ah yes, digesting issues. It's like my body is protesting all of a sudden! 

And now, headaches. Frequent ones. I wake up with them sometimes, other times they come on during the day. I've been taking those little white pills... you know, what are they called? (chuckles) Oh dear, it'll come to me! Headaches, yes. And my vision's not what it used to be. Blurry, especially in the mornings. My glasses need adjusting, but I'm not sure if that's related or just getting old...","Dear me... Oh dear... I don't know if this is related but I was just thinkin' about my cousin Edna, she had some problems with her stomach too... Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, acid reflux. It's been actin' up somethin' fierce lately. Food just sits in my chest like a rock, you know? Can't swallow nothin'. And then the headaches, oh boy... Always feel like there's a big ol' weight on my forehead. Can't even watch TV without gettin' one.

Now, I don't remember if it was last week or the week before, but I think I had some of those little white pills for the acid. Or was it the blood pressure? Shoot, I always get those mixed up... (pauses) Oh, and my vision's been actin' up too. Can't see nothin' without my glasses. Always have to squint. You know, like when you're tryin' to read a book in the sun.

Now, let me think for a minute... (trails off) Oh, I remember! My aunt Mildred had some trouble with her eyes too. She was always sayin' they were gettin' all cataract-y or somethin'. I wonder if that's what's wrong with me... (pauses again) Oh dear, where was I? Ah yes, the food. Can't digest it like I used to. Always feels like a big ol' knot in my tummy.

I'm gettin' old, I guess. Too much thinkin' about Edna and Aunt Mildred... What was I supposed to be tellin' you again?"
112,Migraine,"I have been feeling hungry all the time and have had a sore neck, as well as problems with my vision.","""Doc... I've been feelin' like I'm starvin' all the time, ya know? Even after I eat a big ol' plate of chicken and mashed potatoes, I'm hungry again an hour later. And my neck... oh boy, it's been sore somethin' fierce. Can't even turn my head without wincin'. Now, let me think... when was that last time I saw the girls? Ah, yes! My sister-in-law Edna and her friend Mildred came over for dinner last week... or was it the week before? Hmm... Anyway, I was talkin' to 'em about my garden, and I swear, my eyes just got all fuzzy. Can't see nothing past 5 feet without squintin'. And now that I think about it, it's been like this for a while... but I'm not sure how long exactly... (pauses) Oh dear, what was I sayin'?""","I've been feelin' so... so... peckish all the time, you know? Can't seem to get enough to eat. Even after I just ate a big ol' dinner at my daughter's house yesterday. My stomach's always growlin', like it's tryin' to tell me somethin'. And then there's this soreness in my neck... (pauses) Oh, what was the name of that doctor I saw years ago? You know, the one who did the X-rays on my back? Ah, yes! Dr. Thompson! Anyway, I digress... My neck's been botherin' me somethin' fierce, especially when I try to turn it this way (demonstrates). It gets all stiff and achy.

Now, about these problems with my vision... (pauses again) What was the word we were lookin' for? Ah yes! Dizziness. That's it. My eyesight's been actin' up somethin' fierce. Everything looks blurry, like I'm seein' through a thin veil of water or somethin'. And don't even get me started on my glasses. Can't seem to find the right prescription... (mutters to self) Now, where did I put those darn things? Ah yes! My daughter's house... (chuckles)

What was it you asked me again, dear? Oh, and one more thing: has anyone seen my dog? That ol' rascal's been hidin' under the bed again."
113,Migraine,"In addition to having a stiff neck and eye issues, I have been always hungry.","Now, let me think... what was it you wanted to know? Oh, my symptoms. (pauses) Yes... I've been feeling a bit stiff in my neck, like when I used to lift those heavy suitcases for my sister's move... you know, that one... (chuckles) Anyway... and my eyes, well, they've been getting a bit dry at night, like after watching a long movie. And I always seem to be hungry, all the time. No matter how much I eat, I'm just... famished. Like when I was a young girl, we'd go on walks in the woods and have to pick berries for lunch. (trails off) Now, what were we talking about again? Ah yes, my symptoms.","I'm tellin' ya, Doc... (pauses) I've been feelin' pretty crummy lately. This neck of mine, it's as stiff as a board, you know? I mean, I was tryin' to turn my head just now, and ow! It hurts somethin' fierce. And these eyes of mine, they've been actin' up something awful. (pauses again) Now, where did I put that aspirin...? Oh yes, the eyes.

You see, it started with this one day when I was cookin' dinner for my grandkids. They love it when I make them... (trails off) what's that other thing I was sayin'? Ah yes! They love it when I make 'em spaghetti sauce from scratch. Now, where was I? Oh right, the eyes.

So, they've been watery and red, like someone poured ketchup in 'em. And I've had to rub 'em a lot lately, but that just makes 'em feel... (pauses) all gritty-like. Not nice at all.

And another thing, Doc – I'm always hungry. Always! (laughs) You'd think I was tryin' to fatten myself up for winter or somethin'. But no, it's not like that. It's just... (pauses again) Now what was the other thing? Ah yes! My wife used to make these wonderful chicken pot pies when we were first married. She put so much love in 'em... (trails off)

Anyway... back to this neck and eye business. Like I said, it started with a stiff neck, but then the eyes got all wonky too. Now my head's always feelin' like there's a weight on it... (pauses once more) You know what that reminds me of? That one time we went to the beach in '54..."
114,Migraine,"I have been experiencing acidity, indigestion, headaches, and blurred and distorted vision, as well as excessive hunger, a stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbance.","I've been having some trouble with my... uh... stomach, I think it's been going on for weeks now? Or is it months? Oh dear, time just flies by nowadays. Anyway, I get this acidity and indigestion after eating, especially if I eat too much of that nice lasagna at the church dinner. And then there's these headaches, you know, not too bad but... (pauses) what was I saying? Ah yes, my vision. It gets all blurred and distorted, like when I'm trying to watch TV in the evening. 

And I'm hungry all the time! Must be eating more than I used to. My neck's been feeling stiff for a bit now too. Like when I tried on that new hat at the store... (chuckles) anyway, depression's been getting to me some days, and irritability... just don't seem to have any patience anymore. And then there's these visual disturbances... (pauses, looking confused) Wait, is it morning or afternoon?","I'm gettin' these acid feelings in my stomach, you know? Like a burnin', it is. And then this... this indigestion, I don't rightly know if that's different from the acidity, but it feels like somethin's all twisted up inside me.

And headaches! Lord have mercy, they're gettin' worse. Can't even think straight no more. (pauses) You know, I was talkin' to my sister the other day... she said her neighbor's cat had a tumor or somethin'. Felt kinda sorry for that poor animal... (trails off)

Oh, yeah! My vision! It's all fuzzy and distorted now. Like lookin' through water or somethin'. I remember when I was young, we didn't have these new-fangled glasses... my cousin had some kinda contraption to help him see... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was the name of that thing?

And then there's this hollowness inside me. Like my belly's always growlin', even after I eat. Stomach's all upset, I reckon. (pauses) Now, where did I put my reading glasses? I swear I had 'em right here...

Neck feels stiff like a board, too. Can't even turn it without gettin' this awful creakin' sound... you know how that is, don't you? (laughs) No, no, of course not! (clears throat)

And on top of all this, I'm feelin' mighty down. Irritable, like a wild animal or somethin'. Can't even watch my favorite TV show without gettin' all upset... what's it called again? You know, that one with the horses... (stares off into space)"

(stops suddenly) No, no, not now. Focus.

Now, where did I put those papers I needed to sign for the garden club? (mumbles to self) Oh dear, what was it again? Anyway... headaches. Terrible headaches. Like a weight's pressing down on my head. And these indigestion pains, oh boy! Heartburn, acid reflux... all that jazz. Just like when I... (pauses, looks around the room) Did I leave the stove on?

Oh, and have you seen my glasses? I swear they were just here a minute ago... (chuckles nervously) No matter. You see, it's not just my neck or these pains in my stomach. It's everything. Visual disturbances... I don't know how to explain. Blurred vision, like looking through water. (starts getting agitated) And the impatience! Lord have mercy, I get irritable over nothing. Can't sit still for a minute.

My nephew used to be just like that when he was young... (trails off) Wait, what were we talking about again? Oh yes, my symptoms. (sighs) And then there's this feeling of being down, depressed. Can't put my finger on it, but... (shrugs)

Anyway, stiff neck, and then there's this other stuff. Depression, I suppose you could say. Feeling down all the time. Don't know why, just do. And impatience! Good grief, I get irritable so easily now. Like when my granddaughter comes over, and she can't even... (laughs) Well, never mind.

And then there's these problems with my eyes. Blurred vision, you see? Like trying to read the newspaper in bright sunlight. Can't make out the words no more. And headaches! Lord have mercy, they're awful. Like someone's squeezing my head all the time.

Indigestion too... Ugh, stomach troubles. Don't know what's wrong with me. (pauses) Did I ever tell you about the time we went to Europe? Fascinating trip. Saw so many wonderful sights. Oh dear...

Oh yes, the ones with the funny name... (pauses) Ah, never mind. And my eyesight's been blurry lately, like looking through water or something. (chuckles) And I'm always hungry!

Oh, right! The headaches. They started after that dinner party at my sister's house. You remember, don't you? No, of course not... (chuckles) Anyway... impaired vision... I'm pretty sure it's just a side effect from taking the blood pressure meds. Not that they're working all too well anymore... (muttering to self) Maybe I should ask about those... anyway...

Hunger! That's another thing. Always feeling famished, like my stomach is trying to eat itself. And this sore neck... it feels like someone's been wrestling with me in the middle of the night.

And then there's the depression. Feels like... (pauses, searching for words) Well, you know when you're feelin' down in the dumps? Like the whole world's against you and nothin' makes sense? That's what it feels like every day.

And irritability! Good Lord, I'm gettin' irritable just thinkin' about all this... (trails off)"
121,Migraine,"In addition to recurrent headaches and blurred vision, increased appetite, a stiff neck, sadness, irritability, and visual disturbance, I have been having stomach problems, including indigestion and acidity.","You know, doc... I've been having these headaches again, can't seem to shake 'em off. And my eyesight, dear me... blurry vision, like I'm looking through a foggy window.

I mean, I've always had a bit of a big eater in me, but lately... (pauses to collect thoughts)

Now, let me see if I can remember everything... my neck's been stiff for weeks now, and I'm feeling just as down as a wet sock on a rainy day. Irritable, yes, that's the word. And then there's this visual disturbance business... like I'm seeing things out of the corner of my eye, you know? (hesitates) Oh dear, what was I saying? Ah yes, stomach issues. Indigestion and acidity, just terrible. (pauses to scratch arm) Now, where did I put that paper with all my appointments?","I'm gettin' these headaches again, doc... can't remember when they started, but I think it was around... (pauses) ...around tax season last year? No, no, that's not right. Must've been before then. Oh dear, my mind's a jumble. Anyway, the headaches, yeah... and then there's this blurry vision thingy. Can't quite put my finger on when it began, but I recall thinkin' it was just tired eyes from watchin' too much TV. (chuckles) I used to love watchin' TV, you know? 

Now, about these headaches... they're mostly in the forehead area, right here (taps forehead). Sometimes they radiate down my neck. And that's not all, either. My appetite's gone haywire! I'm eatin' like a bird, but then I wake up at 3 am thinkin', ""What was it I wanted to have for breakfast?"" (laughs) Oh dear, I'm gettin' old, I suppose.

I've also been feelin' quite stiff in my neck. It's like someone's poured cold water down my spine. And the sadness... oh boy, that's a doozy. I find myself cryin' at the silliest things – a commercial on TV, a sentimental story from my childhood... (sniffles) Excuse me.

And then there are these stomach issues. I'm gettin' this indigestion and acidity thingy... don't know if it's related to the other stuff or not, but I've been takin' Tums like they're goin' outta style! My granddaughter said I should try ginger tea instead. (pauses) Did I tell you about my granddaughter? She's a clever one...

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes... the stomach problems. It's this... it's like a knot in my gut, always feelin' like somethin' needs to come up. Don't know if it's food poisonin' or whatnot... (trails off)"

I've been eatin' more than usual, too much food, if you ask my husband. (chuckles) And my neck, it's all stiff and sore. Can't even turn my head without wincin'. And the anxiety, Lord have mercy... I'm gettin' so irritable with everyone. Just snapped at my grandson the other day for no reason at all. (sighs)

And then there's these stomach problems... indigestion, acidity... (pauses) Did we schedule that appointment with my eye doctor? No, wait, it was last week... or was it this week? Ah, dearie me... anyway, I'm gettin' a bit mixed up. Oh yes, the stomach trouble.

One day I woke up feelin' like someone'd hit me over the head with a hammer. Blurred vision too... can't see the TV without squintin'. And my appetite's been through the roof, if you know what I mean. Can't eat enough, no matter how much food I put in front of myself.

Now, this neck of mine... stiff as a board. Can barely turn it to look over my shoulder. Must've slept funny or somethin'... Don't remember nothin' about last night, though. Guess I musta just had a light sleep... (pauses) What was I sayin'? Oh yes...

Anxiety's been gettin' the best of me too. Can't sit still for two seconds without fidgetin'. Irritability, that's the word... can't be around folks right now without losin' my temper. And them visual disturbances... lights flashin' behind my eyes like a firework display.

Now, stomach troubles. Indigestion and acidity... Lord have mercy, it's like a burn in my gut every time I eat somethin'. (pauses) My wife's been sayin' I need to cut back on the coffee, but I don't see how that'll help none. Must be all this rain we've been gettin', makin' me anxious... or maybe it's the new neighbors... no, no, that can't be it... (trails off)

Gave myself a bit of indigestion just talkin' about it now. Think I might need to take some Tums or somethin'. Just give me my medicine and send me on my way, would ya?"

These symptoms started about... um... when was it? Last week? No, no, it feels like longer. Anyway, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce. And these headaches! Like a vice squeezin' my head... can't even think straight.

And then there's the vision thing. Blurred and distorted, you know? Can't read the newspaper, or watch TV without gettin' all queasy... and I'm always hungry, like I haven't eaten in days. And this sore neck of mine... what was it again? Ah yes, my son, Jimmy, he's got one just like it from golfin'. 

I've been feelin' down too, irritable with everyone. Can't even enjoy a simple walk around the block without gettin' all worked up... and I keep seein' these... (taps forehead) what do you call 'em? Distortions in my vision? Yeah, like wavy lines and colors...","I'm so glad I came in today, doc... been feelin' just terrible for weeks now.

I'm thinkin' she took some antacids or... or was it Tums? Anyway, never mind about that.

And then there's these headaches... just awful. Like someone's takin' a sledgehammer to me skull. (chuckles) I remember when my boy had those kinds of headaches... he was playin' too much video games, if you know what I mean.

But it's not just the headaches, doc. My vision... well, let's just say it's not what it used to be. Things are all blurry and distorted... like lookin' through water. And I'm gettin' these strange visual disturbances... like seein' things outta the corner of my eye. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time I saw a deer in our backyard? Oh, never mind.

And then there's this hunger... excessive, that is. I mean, I'm eatin' all day long, but I just can't seem to get full. It's like my stomach's emptier than an old shoebox. (laughs) And don't even get me started on my neck... it's sore somethin' fierce.

And depression... well, I reckon that's a given. Feels like the whole world is weighin' me down. Irritability too... just can't seem to keep my temper in check no more. (sighs) Sorry about all this, doc... just feel like I'm fallin' apart at the seams.

My neighbor, Mrs. Jenkins? No, wait, is she still living there? Anyway... I've had the blues lately. Can't seem to shake this sadness off. And then there's my temper. Oh dear me, I get impatient so easily nowadays. It's like... have you seen that new park downtown? Beautiful flowers they planted last week.

Now, what was I saying? Ah yes! My eyes. Well, it's like when you're driving at night and the streetlights are all fuzzy, but worse than that. Blurred vision, distorted shapes. Can't make out faces anymore... or is that just a side effect of my reading glasses? Ugh, now I'm worried about those too...","I'm so glad you're here, Doctor... or is that Nurse? Wait, no, I'm sure it's a doctor. Anyway... (pauses) My headaches have been terrible lately. Like a vice in my head, you know? (chuckles) Vise, not vice. And the indigestion, oh dear... feels like my stomach's trying to eat itself. Acid reflux, yes, I've had that before. Too much coffee, I'm sure of it. But this time... (trails off)

Oh, what was I saying? Ah yes, appetite. Excessive appetite. Been eating all day, every day. My wife says I'm getting a bit... rounder. (laughs) Rounder, that's a good one. And my neck, oh dear lord... it hurts like the devil himself is sitting on me. Sore neck, that's what I need to tell you about.

Now, let's see... sadness and impatience, yes, those too. Just feeling down in the dumps, you know? Like I've lost my favorite sweater or something. (pauses) Favorite sweater... was it blue? No, no, that's not right... (trails off)

And then there's this visual disturbance business... blurred and distorted vision, is what they call it. (stammers) Can't quite put my finger on it. It's like looking through a funhouse mirror or something. Or maybe I just need glasses again? (laughs nervously) Do you think that might be it, Doctor? Glasses?"

We went on that long drive and I think it was too much sun, maybe. Anyway... along with those headaches, I get this indigestion, right after breakfast, like clockwork. And the acid reflux, Lord have mercy, it's like a fire burning in my chest. And I just can't stop eating, no matter how full I am! My wife says I'm getting plumper by the day... (chuckles) Excuse me.

Now, about that sore neck... think it started after I fell on that patch of ice outside last winter? Or was it this spring? Hmm... anyway. It's been bothering me something fierce. And these feelings of sadness and impatience, they just seem to stick with me all day long. Can't remember the last time I felt happy for more than an hour, if you know what I mean.

And then there's my vision... I've had blurred and distorted vision, like looking through a foggy windowpane. That's not normal, is it?","I don't know if you'll believe me, but I've been having these headaches... (pauses) Oh, where did I put my dentures? Ah, there they are. Anyway, these headaches... and the stomach... it feels like a knife in my side. You know how sometimes you eat something and then it comes back up? That's what I'm experiencing. Acid reflux, they call it. My sister had that too. She said it was awful. (pauses to think) What was I saying?

Oh yes, the headaches... and this appetite of mine. I mean, I love food, but it seems like I could eat a whole turkey by myself. That's not normal, is it? (laughs nervously) And my neck... it hurts something awful. I think it might be from sleeping funny. Or was it that time I fell on the stairs? No, wait, that was just last week. (chuckles)

Now, let me try to remember what else... sadness and impatience, yes. Those have been following me around like a pair of old friends. And this vision business... blurred and distorted, they said. That's not very scientific, is it? (pauses) I had a cousin who went blind in one eye from diabetes. Wasn't that terrible? (trails off)

Now where was I? Ah yes, my vision. It feels like looking through a dirty windowpane. Or maybe it's just the lenses in these glasses. I should get them checked... (pauses again) Wait, what were we talking about again?"

And indigestion, of course, after eating that big ol' plate of spaghetti last week... or was it the night before? Ugh, my mind's gone blank again.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, symptoms. I also get these headaches, pretty regular now. Can't quite recall when they started, though. Must've been around... hmm... after that car ride with Edna to the park? No, no, it wasn't the park, but you know what I mean.

Blurred vision's been a problem too. Like looking through water or something. And hunger! Lord have mercy, I'm always hungry now. Stomach growls like a bear all day long... (pauses to collect thoughts) Oh, and my neck gets stiff sometimes. Don't know why, but it just does.

(Chuckles slightly) Now, what was that thing? Oh yes, sadness! Been feeling rather... down, I suppose you'd say. And patience's gone out the window. Can't even watch TV without getting all worked up.

Anyway, doc, so I've got these headaches comin' on every day. Blurred vis-ion, like when I'm readin' a book or watchin' TV, everything's all fuzzy. And my stomach's always growlin', increased hunger, you know? Like I could eat a whole pizza by myself. (chuckles) Not that I do, of course.

My neck's been stiff too. It feels like someone's got their fingers twisted in it. And this sadness, impa-tience... (pauses again) Did I tell you about my cousin's cat? Passed away last week. Poor thing.

Now, let me think... what else was I sayin'? Oh yeah! Visual disruption. That's what they call it, right? When your eyes are all wonky and stuff?

Anyway, headaches. Ugh, they're just awful. And this distorted vision... now and then, things look all fuzzy or wavy. Like looking through a dirty window. (chuckles to self) Dirty windows, I had some trouble with those at the old house... needed to clean them every week...

And my neck, doc! It's so sore. Must be from sleeping wrong. Again. I don't know how many times I've woken up with this pain in my neck... (stares off into space) Did I mention my cousin's daughter got married last year? Nice wedding, nice cake...

Oh yes, depression and irritability. That's been a problem for years too. Sometimes I just feel so down, don't know why... and then there are these mood swings. Snap out of it one minute, cry the next... (gulps) Visual disturbance... is that what you called it? Distorted vision... maybe it's my glasses. I should get those checked...

My vision's all fuzzy and distorted too. Can't even read the news without squintin'. And have you ever tried eatin' a whole pizza by yourself in one sittin'? (chuckles) Oh boy, that was a mistake... Increased appetite, that's what I got. Stomach's always growlin', like it's tryin' to tell me somethin'. Neck feels stiff too, like someone's been playin' tug-of-war with my spine. And the depression... well, you know how it is when you just feel down and can't get outta bed? (pauses) Oh, I remember now! My cousin Edna used to say that a good walk in the park would fix that right up... Visual distortion, hazy, like lookin' through a foggy window. And irritation, oh boy... don't even get me started on that one.","I don't know if I'm gettin' old or what, but... (pauses) Oh boy, my stomach's been actin' up somethin' fierce! It's like a big ol' acid bath in there, you know? (chuckles) Indigestion, they call it. Can't eat nothin' without feelin' like it's burnin' me from the inside out. And these headaches... Lord have mercy, they're so bad I can barely think straight sometimes! Like a big ol' weight is sittin' on my temples, just pressin' and pressin'. (pauses to collect thoughts)

You know what's weird? My eyesight ain't been the same neither. Things look all hazy and distorted, like tryin' to watch TV through water. Can't even read nothin' without squintin' like a hawk! (trails off) Speakin' of which... I remember when my grandma used to make me these little sandwiches with cucumber slices on 'em. She said it'd help with the eyes, you see... (chuckles) Don't know if that's true or not, but... 

Oh yes, and I get so hungry all the time! It's like an empty hole in my belly just waitin' to be filled. Increased appetite, they call it. I swear, I could eat a whole cow by myself sometimes! (laughs) And then there's this stiff neck business. Can't turn my head without feelin' like I'm gonna break somethin'. My wife says I'm just gettin' old and set in my ways... (pauses)

Now, what was the other thing? Ah yes, depression! (sadly) Lord, it gets me down somethin' fierce. Feel like just givin' up sometimes, you know? Can't do nothin', can't see nothin', just feelin' stuck. And irritability... well, don't even get me started on that! Just want to yell at the wall sometimes and shake my fist in frustration! (sighs) Visual distortion, is it called? Yeah, I get that too. It's like tryin' to watch a movie through a wavy mirror or somethin'...

Like that time I went on that trip with the seniors' group and we had to take a tour of that museum... (pauses) anyway... depression's been gettin' me down too. Can't seem to find anything to watch on TV no more. And them headaches, oh boy... they're just killers. Blurred vision's another one, it's like lookin' through a foggy window.

This appetite of mine is through the roof! I mean, I'm always hungry. Always. And my neck... oh dear, it's stiff as a board. I can hardly move it without wincin'. (pauses) Did I tell you about that time I visited my cousin in Florida? Beautiful weather, lovely people... anyway...

And then there's this depression business. Just feelin' down all the time. Can't seem to shake it off. My grandkids always say, ""Grandma, what's wrong?"" And I'm thinkin', ""What am I doin' wrong?"" (chuckles) Oh dear, I get so... distracted...

Now, my impatience is another thing altogether. Fussin' at the kids to hurry up with their breakfast. I mean, I used to be a patient person, but now... (pauses) What was that other thing? Ah yes! Visual disturbances. Blurred vision's been plaguin' me somethin' fierce. And headaches! Lord have mercy, they're as bad as a hangover.

Blurred vision, you know? Makes it hard to see what I'm doin'. Now, let me think when this all started... (pauses) Oh dear, I was at the market last week and saw that nice young fella from the bank... what's his name now? Ah, yes! Mr. Johnson! Anyway, I digress.

I've also been feelin' rather down in the dumps, irritability's gotten the best of me, and my neck's just as tight as a drum. And with all these symptoms, it's like my appetite's gone haywire. Can't stop eatin', but don't know why... (chuckles) I guess that's what happens when you're gettin' on in years!

Been havin' trouble turnin' my head, if you know what I mean. And depression? Oh boy, it's been comin' on strong. Can't even watch TV without gettin' all teary-eyed. Irritability, too... (chuckles) My wife says I'm a bear with a sore head.

But the real trouble is this acid reflux business. Ugh, I swear it's been worse than the kids when they were young. (laughs) They used to think they could just yell and scream all day long... (trails off)

Indigestion? Well, that's no surprise with what I've been puttin' away. Can't even recall the last time I had a decent cup of coffee without feelin' like it's comin' back up. And these headaches? Lord have mercy... I thought I was havin' heart palpitations at first, but my sister Edna says it's just stress.

(starts to wander off-topic)

You know, I remember when I used to work at the mill... (pauses) What was I sayin'? Oh yes! The headaches. They're like a weight on my head. And this blurred vision? Nothin' like seein' two of everythin', if you catch my drift. It's like lookin' through water, but not just any water – it's like bein' underwater in a lake with no bottom.

I don't know how much more of this I can take. Disturbin' all the time... interferin' with me usual activities, like watchin' my stories or tinkerin' with my garden... (trails off)"

Now where was I? Oh yeah, my symptoms. Like I said, acid reflux and indigestion. And don't forget the headaches. My eyesight's been actin' up too. Can't see nothin' more than five feet in front of me without gettin' all dizzy-like. Must be the cataracts... or is it glaucoma? Hmm, can't remember which one I had surgery for last year... anyway...

And then there's this constant hunger pang. Like a growl in my belly all day long. Makes it hard to focus on nothin', ya know?

I also get these headaches, all the time. Tension headaches, migraines... sometimes it feels like someone's squeezing my head in a vice. (chuckles to herself) And then there's my neck. It's so sore... I think I strained it while gardening last week... no, was it this week? (laughs) Oh dear, anyway...

Now about these vision problems... blurred vision, double vision... it's like looking through a foggy windowpane. And I'm always hungry! Excessive hunger, they call it, don't they? (pauses to think) Wait, what were we talking about again?

Depression and irritability, yes... that's been a challenge too. Can't seem to get out of bed in the morning... or sometimes I just want to yell at everyone for no reason. (giggles nervously) Oh dear me! And these visual disturbances... I see things out of the corner of my eye, but when I turn to look, they're gone.

And then there's these headaches... (taps forehead) right here. Like someone's hammerin' away with a sledgehammer. And don't even get me started on the sweatin'! Must be a million sweat droplets an hour... I swear, it's like I'm drippin' oil!

My muscles hurt somethin' fierce too. Can't even lift my arm without wincin'. (gulps) Like someone's puttin' a vice grip on me.

You know what they say: ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."" But I'm thinkin', doc... when life gives you chills, headaches, and muscle pain... what do you get? A whole lotta misery! (laughs weakly) Oh dear...

By the way, did I tell you about my sister's cat? She had some funny business with her whiskers one time..."
255,Malaria,"I've had a high fever, chills, and intense itching. In addition, I have a headache and am perspiring a lot. My muscles hurt a lot, and I feel sick.","I've had this high fever... (pauses) You know, my cousin Edna had that same thing last year, but hers went away after a few days. I think it was her daughter-in-law who took care of her. Anyway... chills, yeah, and intense itching all over my body. My skin feels like it's crawling. (chuckles slightly) It reminds me of when I was a kid and got those awful mosquito bites.

My head, it hurts so much. And I'm sweating buckets, just like after that hot summer day at the beach last week... or was it two weeks ago? (laughs) Oh dear, my memory's not what it used to be. My muscles, they ache all over. I feel really sick, like when I had that nasty flu back in '07. (pauses, collecting thoughts) This feels different though.","I don't know if it's this cold weather... or maybe it was that time I got a flu shot last year? Anyway, doc... (pauses) Excuse me, where did I put my glasses? Ah yes, my symptoms... I've had this high fever for days now. I'm talking 102, easy. Chills too, can't even sit still without shivering like an old dog. And don't even get me started on the itching! (laughs) It's like my skin is crawling with mosquitoes! Or was it ants? Wait, no... I remember it was ants once before...

Oh dear, where am I going with this? (chuckles) Focus, Edith! Focus! Ah yes, so the itching. And then there's this headache... Throbbing, you know? Like my head is a drum in a marching band. Or was that my grandson's birthday party last week? (laughs again) Oh dearie me!

And sweating... Lord have mercy, I'm dripping like a faucet! Must be all the tea I've been drinking. Speaking of which, have you tried that new herbal stuff at the market? It's got all sorts of good stuff in it, I think. Anyway...

Muscles ache something fierce too. Can't even lift my arm without feeling like it's gonna fall off. And then there's this... sickness. (pauses) What was I saying? Oh yes! This feeling of being unwell. It's just not right, doc... Not at all."

Vomit... oh dear Lord, it just came up again. My fever's through the roof, sweatin' like crazy too. Headache's killin' me, nauseous as can be. Muscles ache somethin' awful. Now what was I sayin'? Oh yeah, my grandson Jimmy, he's got a new puppy... (chuckles) anyway... when did this start? Was it last Tuesday or Wednesday? Ah, doesn't matter. Just know I'm feelin' terrible. All these symptoms since... umm... well, maybe it started after that dinner at the restaurant... you know, the one with the loud music.""","Wait, let me think... I've had this itching, you see... on my skin, all over. Like someone's got a cheese grater under my clothes. Chills too, that's what it feels like. I know we used to have those cold blankets when I was a kid, but this is different... (pauses) Oh dear, where was the store with the good prices on chicken? Ah yes, itching.

Vomiting, it started yesterday evening. Couldn't keep nothing down. Thought maybe it was that milk, not sure if it was still good. Expired, you know... But I'm pretty sure it's not just the milk. Fever, oh boy... (stammers) high, very high. Like when my sister had that 104 fever and I had to take her to the doctor, Dr. Smith... no, wait, we didn't live near him then.

(chuckles) Anyway... sweating, like someone's poured a bucket of water on me. That cold shower from last week still lingers, you know? (laughs slightly) Oh dear Lord, what was I saying? Ah yes, the itching. And my head... headache, all day long. Always tired, even when I slept for hours... (pauses, thinking)

And then there's this... pain. In my muscles. Like someone's got a vise grip on me. Nauseous too... no food tastes good to me anymore. We used to eat at that nice diner downtown, but it doesn't taste the same now... What was I saying? Oh yes, pain... (sighs)"

I don't know how many times I've been to the bathroom today... was it yesterday? Anyway, I think it's three days now... fever's so high I feel like my head's gonna burst. Sweatin' buckets, too... I swear, I need a new set of sheets for this house! And queasy, oh boy... can't keep nothin' down. And this headache, doc? Excruciating is the word... hurts somethin' fierce. My muscles, dear Lord... it feels like someone's been beatin' me with a stick all night long.

You know, I was just thinkin', I shoulda taken that vitamin C yesterday like my daughter reminded me to. Would've kept this from happenin', probably. And did I tell you about the time I went to the doctor for that flu shot?...","Oh dearie me... I don't know if I'm gettin' all this right, but... you see, I've been feelin' just awful, doc. Got these... uh, these itches all over my body. Legs, arms, even my face. It's like ants are crawlin' under my skin or somethin'. (pauses) Now where did I put that tea kettle? I was makin' myself a cup of tea just the other day...

Anyway, like I said, itches and... and this chillin', too. I'm shakin' like a leaf. And then there's the... uh, you know, them stomach troubles. I've been... (pauses again) Oh, I remember now! We had that nice dinner at the church hall last week. My friend Mabel made those lovely roast potatoes...

But where was I? Ah yes, the vomiting. It's like my insides are churnin' somethin' fierce. And the fever, dear me... it's like a fire burnin' through me veins. (rubs arms) Got all these sweats, too. Just drippin' wet. Like after I took that long bath on Saturday...

And then there's this... pain. In my muscles, like they're all cramped up and sore. Can't even lift my arm without... (sighs) You know what? It reminds me of when I was a young girl, we used to go out pickin' wildflowers in the fields behind our house...

(Trails off)

I think that's it, dear doc. Or maybe not. What were you askin'?"
258,Malaria,"Along with severe body itchiness, chills, and nausea, I've been experiencing. I've been severely perspiring and have a very high fever. I'm feeling queasy and also have a headache. Really hurting muscles are me.",".. along with this... itchiness all over my body, chills, and I get these awful... feel queasy you know? Like when I ate that... uh... what was it again? That new soup at the church dinner last week... anyway... I've been sweating like crazy too. And my fever's been really high, doc... must be a hundred and three or something. My head hurts somethin' fierce, like a big ol' knot in here. Now, let me think... when was it again? Monday? No, that's right, Tuesday I went to the doctor with those... uh... you know, my neighbor Mrs. Jenkins said she had some... oh dear, what's gotten into me today! Ah yes, my muscles, they're just... really hurtin' me.

(pauses) You know, my husband always said I got too many clothes on in the summer, but now it's wintertime and I'm still feeling... all hot and sweaty. And that fever, Lord have mercy, it's been a while since I've had one this bad. My skin feels like it's on fire, if you know what I mean. 

(chuckles) Oh boy, my grandmother used to tell me stories about when she was young, and how the doctor would come to their house... (pauses) Wait, where was I? Ah yes, fever. It's really high, dear. I'm not sure what's going on with me. My muscles are all achy too, like someone poured sugar in my joints. And this headache, it won't go away no matter how many aspirin... or is it ibuprofen? (giggles) Oh dear, I always get those two mixed up.

Really hurting muscles are... (pauses) You know what I mean, Doc? My arms and legs and back... all of them. It's hard to move around when you feel like your bones are on fire. Chills are really bad too. I'll be sitting there watching TV, and suddenly my whole body starts shivering like a leaf. And that nausea, it comes out of nowhere... (pauses) Just thinking about food makes me queasy now."

Got a fever, you know? Don't know what temperature it is, but my thermometer's always breakin' nowadays. Vomited all over the kitchen floor this mornin'. Oh dear Lord, still got that stain on the rug... Ugh, and this headache of mine! My poor head feels like someone's poundin' a drum in there. Muscles? Ah yes... they're achy, doc. Like I just ran a marathon or somethin'.""","Doc... (coughs) Oh dear, I think I'm getting a bit of a cold again. Can't remember when my last one was... Wasn't it just before... uh, Christmas? Anyway, this time around, I've been feeling quite... icky. My whole body's itchin' like crazy, and the chills, oh my goodness, they're so bad! (pauses) Did I ever tell you about that time I went to the beach in Florida? My skin was so sensitive from all the sun... Ah yes, the sun. Anyway, I'm shivering something awful.

Now, where did I put that glass of water? (rummages through papers on desk) Oh dear, not here, I guess. Mmm... water. You know, when I was a kid, we used to get water from a well in our backyard. It was the most wonderful thing! Now it's all tap water and... (trails off)

Where was I? Ah yes, my symptoms. Well, I've been vomiting quite a bit too. And this fever of mine is just through the roof! (whispers) I don't like being hot when it's already hot outside. Sweating buckets doesn't help either. Feel queasy, you know, like I'm about to... (pauses, looks puzzled) You know what? I think I once had a bad case of food poisoning from eating some spoiled chicken. Wasn't that last week? Or was it this week?

And my muscles! Good grief, they're killing me! In excruciating discomfort, just like you said in... (looks around) where's my pillbox?

Nausea's a regular visitor now, too. (chuckles) Get a glass of water, would ya? My mouth's all dry.

Fever's through the roof, I'm sure of it. High as a kite... or was that just last week when I had that cold? No, no, this is different. (pauses to think) I've been sweatin' buckets, too... must be over a hundred degrees in here, I swear. Can't even keep my eyes open sometimes.

And my stomach... don't even get me started. Sick as a dog. Feel like I'm gonna pass out just thinkin' about eatin'. Headache's been constant, though... (pauses) Wait, what were we talkin' about again? Ah yes, the itchin'! That's the worst part. Can't sleep at night 'cause my skin feels like it's on fire.

And them muscles... ( winces in pain) oh boy, they're killin' me. Must've pulled somethin' or other... now it's just one big ol' knot. Don't know what to do about it. (trails off) Did I tell you about my neighbor's dog? Good boy, that one is... anyway...

My husband used to tell me that all the time...

Now, where was I? Ah yes, the fever. It's like a fire in my belly, just burnin' away. (pauses) Burnin'... You know what burns? These beans I cooked for dinner last night. I put too much salt on 'em. Made me cough somethin' fierce... (chuckles) Get it? Fierce? Ha! Anyway...

Sweat's been drippin' off my face like a faucet, and this headache... It's like someone took a hammer to my poor ol' brain. I just want to curl up in bed and stay there till it passes. But the pain, you see, Doc... (stammers) What was the other thing? Ah yes, nausea! Ugh, don't even get me started on that. And these muscles of mine... (laughs weakly) They're like rubber bands. Too tight. Not tight enough... You know what I mean?

Now what else? Chills, I think it was. No, no, not chills – that's just an old word for when you feel cold, isn't it? (stammers) Ah, but this is more like... shivers. Yeah, that's the ticket! Shivers all over my bones. And these hives, or whatever they're called... (taps leg) You know what I mean? Itchies. That's a nice word for it.

(Fiddles with hands) Now about this head of mine... Hurts somethin' fierce. Not like when I got that headache from eatin' too much cheese – you remember that, don't you? (laughs nervously) Oh dear, I think I might've gotten the dates mixed up. Anyway...

Perspiratin', all right! That's what it is. Sweatin' buckets, like when we used to mow the lawn on a hot summer day... (pauses) Wait a minute... Wasn't that last week? No, I'm sure it was this week... Must've gotten my days mixed up.

Now, this headache... it's not so bad, just a little... (pauses to think) what was I sayin'? Oh right! My head, yeah. And the sweatin', oh boy... I'm talkin' buckets of sweat here. Must be one hundred degrees in here still. (laughs nervously)

Now, let me see... where's my... uh... oh yes! My wife, she said I had this before. Or was it my cousin? No, wait, I remember now. It was that cold we got last winter. (trails off) But that was a different time... (pauses again) Anyway...

Sweatin' buckets too... and this headache of mine is just killin' me. And them nausea spells? Lord have mercy, they're ruinin' my appetite for supper... what was the name of that nice restaurant we went to last week again? Ah yes, the Italian place... no, wait, it was the other one... uh, anyway... and this muscle pain's got me walkin' like an old crone.""

""Wait, when did I last eat? Was it lunch or dinner yesterday? Anyway, my muscles ache somethin' fierce. Discomfort's just eatin' away at me... must be these new dentures of mine causin' all this trouble. Or is it the weather? We had a storm roll in last night, maybe that's got somethin' to do with it...""","I've been feelin' so... achy, you know? And this itchiness, it's like ants crawlin' all over my skin. Can't seem to get rid of it no matter how much I scratch. (pauses) Now, where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes, my niece, Emily, gave it to me last year... anyway... 

I had the chills yesterday, or was it this mornin'? Yeah, must've been both, 'cause I remember shakin' like a leaf and then takin' a hot shower. (trails off) Speakin' of which, have you seen my granddaughter's picture? I took it with me to the... uh... where was that place we went? The one with the nice garden? Oh right, no matter.

Now, as for this fever, well... I think it started on Wednesday? Or was it Tuesday? (chuckles) Doesn't matter. I've been takin' my temperature, and let me tell you, it's high. Very high. And don't even get me started on the sweat. Lord have mercy, I'm like a drippin' faucet! My poor nightgown... 

Vomiting? (pauses) Oh dear, yes. That was this mornin', when I got up to make some tea... or was it coffee? Uh-oh, maybe it was neither... anyway, after that cup of... you know what I mean... I felt queasy and just ran for the bathroom like a madwoman! (giggles) Oh dear.

Oh yes, and this headache... Shoot, I wish I could remember where I put my reading glasses. Now that's what I call a real problem. These... muscles... they're all achy too. And it hurts to move, if you can imagine that. It just makes me want to curl up in bed like a turtle and stay there."
280,Malaria,"I've had a high temperature, vomiting, chills, and intense itching. I also have a headache and am perspiring a lot. I've been really uncomfortable lately from nausea and muscle ache.","I had this high temperature, you see... and I'm pretty sure it started three days ago? Maybe four? Ah dear, my brain isn't what it used to be... anyway... (chuckles) Oh look, I just remembered! We went to the park last week and saw those lovely birds, don't know if you remember that... (pauses)

Now where was I? Ah yes, this temperature. And then there's been this vomiting, which is just awful. Chills too, like my bones are aching. Oh boy, my bones do ache sometimes when it rains, you know? (laughs) Oh dear me...

And let's see... intense itching on my skin, particularly on my arms and legs. It's quite... quite an annoyance, I assure you! And headaches, of course – they're just the worst, especially after all these years with cataracts, if you can imagine. Sweat too; I'm always dripping like a faucet now that I think about it.

As for feeling uncomfortable... well, there's this nausea and muscle ache, which is rather... debilitating, I suppose. (trails off)","I don't know if I'm doin' this right... (pauses) Oh dear, I had a high temperature, ya see? And it just wouldn't go down no matter what I did. I was shiverin', got chills all over my bones. Like when I used to get sick as a child... My mother would always give me some chicken soup and... (trails off) Wait, where's my keys? I could swear I left 'em right here on the table... (chuckles)

Anyway, like I was sayin', this high temperature... And then there's this intense itchin' all over my body. I mean, I've never felt anything like it before. I thought maybe I had an allergy or somethin'. But no, it just kept gettin' worse and worse. (pauses) I also got this terrible headache, right here behind my eyes... Ugh! And the sweatin', oh boy... I'm just drippin' with sweat like a faucet that won't turn off.

Now, let me see if I can remember what else was goin' on... Oh yes, nausea. I couldn't keep nothin' down. Felt like my stomach was turnin' somersaults all the time. And these muscles... (laughs) Oh dear, they just hurt so bad. Like when I pulled my back out last year... No, wait, that wasn't this time. (chuckles) Sorry, what was I sayin'? Ah yes, muscle ache! That's it. Been feelin' pretty lousy for a while now, to be honest with you..."
281,Malaria,"Strong itchiness, chills, nausea, and a high temperature have been plaguing me. Besides having a headache, I'm also perspiring a lot. I've been suffering from severe muscle pain and nausea.","Doc... (pauses) I've got this itchiness, strong like, and I feel so hot all the time. Chills, yes, chills like when I used to go swimming with my grandkids at the lake. My husband, Ed, he's always saying we should get back into it, but (chuckles) I think I'll stick to the couch for now.

Now, where was I? Ah yes, nausea. It's been making me feel just awful. And this temperature, high like... (hesitates) What was that thing you said last week about my blood pressure? Oh dear, I'm getting all mixed up. Oh well.

And then there's the headache. So bad it feels like someone's pounding on my head with a hammer. I've been taking some aspirin, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good. (pauses) Did I tell you about the time we went to see our grandkids at the beach? We had such a wonderful day... Oh dear, anyway...

Oh yes, perspiring. That's right. I'm sweating buckets. And this muscle pain... (sighs) It's just everywhere. My legs, my back... it feels like I've been run over by a truck. Nausea, again. I'm so sick of being sick...","Now, let me tell you... I don't know if this is connected, but I had the most peculiar dream last night... (pauses) Anyway, as I was saying, I've been having these awful itchy feelings all over my body. It started in my hands and feet, now it's like my whole skin's on fire. Chills, you see? That's what it feels like - cold and hot at the same time.

(pauses to recall something) Oh dear, I think I left my tea bag steeping for too long... (mutters to self) Anyway, back to this... My temperature must be off, 'cause I feel just as hot as can be. Can't stop sweating either. Just like that one time at the lake... we were all so young, and it was a heat wave, but this is different... (clears throat)

I'm trying to recall what it is that's causing this... nausea, yes, and my head hurts something awful. It feels like I've been hit by a train. The pain in my muscles - oh boy, I can hardly even move without groaning. Must be the weather changing or something... (pauses) You know, I think I was reading about something similar to this... flu, perhaps? No, no, that's not it... Oh dear me! I'm getting all confused now... (trails off)

I just wish you could understand what I mean. (pauses again) It's like... my body's playing tricks on me. (sighs) Do forgive an old woman her ramblings..."

Shoot, I always get those days mixed up. You know, my sister Edna had a similar problem last year. She thought she was comin' down with the flu, but it turned out to be something else entirely. Ah, yes... anyway, my headache's been poundin' away like a jackhammer. And don't even get me started on the sweatin'. I must've soaked through three sheets already this week... no, wait, is that this week? Uh-oh... Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused now.""","(sigh) Oh dearie me...

And chills, oh Lord have mercy, chills runnin' down my spine like ice water. Don't know why, but my teeth's all achy too.

Now, I think... (pauses, looks around) what was the other thing? Ah yes! Fever. Got a high fever goin' on here. Can feel it in every bone, every muscle. And them headaches... (sigh) Lord have mercy, they're fierce. Make me wanna just curl up and sleep for a week.

Now, sweat... my goodness gracious, I'm sweatin' buckets! Must be a hundred degrees in this room. Don't know how you doctors do it, wearin' all those white coats. (chuckles) Oh, and nausea... yep, that's the other thing. Feel like I'm goin' to heave at any minute.

(rambles on) You know, my grandma used to make me this soup when I was sick... chicken noodle or somethin'. It'd calm me right down. (pauses) What was the question again? Oh dear, got a little mixed up there for a second. Anyway... yeah, just can't seem to shake these symptoms off. Can't concentrate on nothin'... just this feelin' of bein' all clogged up inside..."

Now, about this fever... it started with chills, terrible chills, like someone was walking over my grave. And the itching! Oh my goodness, it's been driving me crazy. My skin feels like it's on fire. (pauses) Did I tell you I saw that nice lady from church at the grocery store yesterday? She looked just lovely... anyway... (clears throat)

My head hurts so much, and I'm sweating buckets. (laughs slightly) I remember when my husband used to get these terrible headaches too... what was it called? Ah yes, migraines! I think that's what they were called... Oh dear, anyway... the muscle aches are just excruciating. It feels like someone poured glue in my joints. And the nausea... (shudders) Well, let's just say I'm not eating much these days.","(sigh) Oh boy... (pause) excuse me, doc... I've been feelin' just terrible lately. High fever, chills, ya know?

I swear, I must've scratched myself raw by now.

(head nodding) Oh yes, and the headache... (pausing to collect thoughts) Now, where did I put that list of things I need to do today? Ah, shoot! Sorry 'bout that... anyway... the headache's been makin' me wanna crawl under a rock. And I'm sweatin' buckets, doc. It's like my body's tryin' to cool itself down or somethin'.

(muttering to self) Now, what was it I wanted to tell you? Oh yes! The pain! (exasperated sigh) My muscles ache somethin' fierce. I can barely move without wincin'. And them cramps... like nothin' I've ever felt before. Nausea too... don't wanna eat nothin', but my stomach's still churnin' away.

Sweating buckets too, like I'm drenched in a sauna. And this headache... Ugh, it's like someone's squeezing my temples with pliers.

Oh yes! The chills. Freezin' cold. Even with the heat on, I feel like I'm ice pickin' through a block of ice. (laughs nervously) Vomiting... well, that's just awful. And this fever... Lord have mercy, it's high. Must be over 103 degrees... (pauses, scratches head)

You know what else? Sweatin'. Too much, if you ask me. My nightgown's stuck to my back. I swear, I'm drippin' like a faucet... (chuckles weakly) 

Now, let's see...(tries to recall) Oh yes! Headache. That's a big one. Throbbin', doc. Makes me want to scream. No, not scream... just wanna lie down and rest my eyes. Nausea too. Can't even look at food. And this muscle pain... (winces)

And headaches! Good grief, they're as bad as my Aunt Edna's gossipin'. Perspirin' like crazy, too. Must be due to all this scratchin', don't you think, Doc... or Dr.?

My muscles ache too, feel like I got hit by a truck. Oh dear, is that what they call it? Ah, yes, nausea... that's the word! Nausea, just plain ol' nauseated somethin' fierce...""","Oh dearie me... (pauses) I'm not feelin' so well, Doc. Got a high fever, you know? Temperature must've been up over 103 yesterday... or was it today? Can't keep track of days no more. (chuckles) My wife says I'm still gettin' used to the new calendar... (trails off)

Anyway, this fever's got me feelin' like the flu's back, but my daughter said that's not what they call it anymore... (pauses again) Oh right, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! Itchin', Doc. My skin's been itch-in' somethin' fierce. Like when I used to get those awful hives as a kid. Must be allergies or somethin'. (hesitates)

And then there's the chills... Lord have mercy, the chills are killin' me! Can't stop shakin', can't even watch TV without gettin' all shivery. Now where did I put my favorite blanket? (gets sidetracked) You know, that one with the elephants on it...

Now, what was I sayin'? Ah yes! The other symptoms... Vomitin's been pretty bad too, Doc. (uses a southern pronunciation) Don't wanna get up from the commode... if you catch my drift. And headaches? Shoot, got those too. Can't even take a shower without feelin' like someone's poundin' on me head with a hammer.

Now I'm gettin' a little confused here... Wasn't it just yesterday morning I saw that nice young man from the bank comin' to visit? (looks around) Where did he go, anyway? Oh yes! Muscle aches. That's what they are. Must've strained myself liftin' my grandkids... or was it helpin' my wife with the dishes? (trails off again)

Sorry 'bout all this, Doc... I'm gettin' old and forgetful... (sighs)"
292,Malaria,"Strong itchiness, chills, nausea, and a high fever are all part of my current condition. Besides having a headache, I've been perspiring a lot. I've been uncomfortable from nausea and muscle ache, too.","You know, I was thinkin' about that time I went on that cruise... (chuckles) Oh dear, what was the year now? Um, anyway... I'm tellin' ya, it's this itchiness, see? It's been drive me crazy! Can't stop scratchin', but it don't help, if you know what I mean. And then there's these chills, like someone's walkin' over my grave or somethin'. High fever, too... (pauses) You'd think I'd be feelin' better by now, considering... Ah, yes! The doctor said I should take some meds for the pain. Speakin' of which, have you seen that new ice cream place downtown? My granddaughter says it's just wonderful...

You know what else is botherin' me? Nausea and muscle aches. Oh dear, I think I'm gettin' all mixed up... When was my appointment with Dr. Smith again? (laughs nervously)","Oh dearie me... (pauses) Ah yes, the itchiness. You see, it's like my skin's on fire, Doc... or maybe it's just my joints, I don't know anymore. They used to ache so much in the winter, but now it's all the time... and the itching! (chuckles) Like ants crawling under my skin, I swear.

Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, chills. That's right, I've been shivering like a leaf, even with the heat on full blast. Nausea, that's another thing... it feels like my stomach's trying to turn inside out. I had a bowl of soup yesterday, and it just... (pauses) no, wait, was it a salad? No, that can't be right... (trails off)

Fever, you know. It's been hovering around 102 for days now. And the headaches! Lord have mercy, they're like someone's hammering on my temples with a sledgehammer. Sweating buckets too... I mean, I'm always sweating in this Florida heat, but this is different. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, what was it we were talking about? Oh yes, the other symptoms.

Muscle ache, that's right. My poor back and shoulders feel like they've been through a wringer. Can't even lift my arms without wincing... (distracted) You know, I used to be able to mow my lawn in an hour flat. Now it takes me all day just to get out of bed... (trails off again)"
293,Malaria,"Strong itchiness, chills, nausea, and a high fever are all part of my current condition. In addition, I have a headache and have been perspiring a lot. I've been suffering from nausea as well as muscle ache.","Doc... or is it nurse? Anyway, I got this awful itchiness, like someone's scratchin' me from the inside out. And chills, yeah, I'm shiverin' like a leaf. Nausea too, makes me feel like I'm gonna heave at any minute. Fever's through the roof, I can feel it. Headache's killin' me, and I've been sweatin' buckets. I mean, I'm not usually one to sweat that much... unless it's in the summer, you know? Reminds me of the time my grandkid, Jimmy... or is it Joey? Anyway, my grandkid was gettin' sick last week too. Must've been a virus or somethin'. Ah, anyway... muscle ache too. That's the worst part, I think. Makes it hard to even sit up straight. (pauses) What day is today, anyway?","I'm gettin' a little... (pauses) ...fussin', if you know what I mean. Got this awful itchiness, like my skin is crawlin'. Can't sit still. And then there's these chills, oh dear me... shakin' all over the place. Like I got a cold or somethin', but I'm sure it's not that. (pauses) Wait, didn't I have pneumonia last year? Or was it my sister? Anyway... 

Now, this fever of mine, it's quite high, I'd say. At least 102. Maybe more. And the sweat, good gravy! I'm drippin' like a faucet. Got nothin' on me but these old sweatpants and a t-shirt. Not exactly the most presentable getup, if you ask me... (chuckles) 

Oh, the headaches! Lord have mercy! Like someone's poundin' away at my poor cranium with a hammer. And don't even get me started on this nausea business. I'm starvin', but nothin' sounds good to eat. Not even a sandwich or some soup. Just... (shrugs) ...just nothing, really.

Now where was I? Ah yes, the muscle ache! It's like my whole body's sayin', ""Slow down, old timer!"" Can't walk without groanin'. (pauses) Now, what were we talkin' about again?"
294,Malaria,"I have a high fever, severe itching, chills, and vomiting. I also have a headache and have been perspiring a lot. My discomfort has also been brought on by nausea and muscle ache.","Oh dearie me... I've got this terrible fever, you see. Been having chills all night, and my skin is just crawling with itching. It's been driving me mad, I kid you not. And I've thrown up at least three times already today... or was it yesterday? Oh wait, no, that was the other time I had a cold. Anyway... (pauses to collect thoughts) Ah yes, vomiting. And my head, dear doctor, is pounding like a drum. I'm sweating buckets, if you can imagine. Just drenched in sweat. My muscles ache something awful too... You know, my cousin Edna's husband, Joe, had something similar once. He was on one of those cruises and came down with some sort of... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I saying?","I don't know if I'm getting this fever from... from... (pauses) you know what I had for dinner last night? Oh dear, it was one of those new-fangled salads with all that kale in it. My wife says it's good for me but I just can't stomach the stuff... anyway... (clears throat)

So, like I said, I have a high fever. Must be over 100 degrees, at least. My thermometer broke last week and my granddaughter was supposed to get me a new one but I haven't seen her in days... probably off visiting them neighbors of hers again... (trails off) You know the ones with all those cats? I swear they have five or six in that tiny house.

Anyway, like I was saying. The fever. And it's giving me chills too. Can't stop shivering even though my heater's cranked up full blast. And the itching! Good grief, it's driving me crazy. My arms and legs are all red and scratchy. Must be a rash or something... (pauses, looks around) Now where did I put that bottle of calamine lotion? Ah yes...

And then there's the vomiting. Ugh, it's like my stomach is doing flips inside out. (laughs weakly) Oh dear me, not again! And this headache... (wipes forehead with handkerchief) feels like someone's hammering away in here. Can't focus on nothing for more than a minute or two. (mumbles to self) Must remember to pick up milk on the way home...

Nausea too. Don't know if I can keep anything down, you see... and these muscle aches! Like someone poured acid all over my joints. My poor back's been complaining like mad for weeks now... probably just old age catching up with me... (chuckles) Oh well.

(pauses to collect thoughts)

Now what was it we were talking about again? Ah yes, the fever. Well, I suppose I should get that checked out if it keeps going on like this. Can't have my system shutting down, not yet! (laughs wheezily)"

Nausea and muscle pain have been making me feel miserable.","""Ah, doctor... I think it started Tuesday? No, wait, was it Monday? Anyway, I been feelin' just awful. Got this intense itchiness, all over my body. Can't sit still, it's drivin' me crazy! And the chills, Lord have mercy, they got me shakin' like a leaf. Then there's the vomiting... Oh dear, don't even get me started on that. I was at church last week, and we were singin' hymns, and suddenly I just had to run out of the room. My daughter, Sally... or is it Susan? Shoot, I always get those two mixed up... Anyway, she said I looked like death warmed over! And the fever, oh my goodness! It's been a few days now... I think? (chuckles) Oh dear, I'm gettin' all confused. What was I sayin'? Ah yes, the sweating! I'm sweatin' like a pig in the summer heat. And this headache... it's just... (pauses, collecting thoughts) Ugh, I feel so miserable.""","I don't know if I should've eaten that tuna sandwich for lunch yesterday... anyway, I woke up this morning feeling just terrible. My skin's been itching something awful, like ants crawling under my skin. Chills, yes, I got chills last night and they wouldn't go away. Then I started throwing up, you know, in the bathroom. My stomach's all upset. And... (pauses) what was it again? Ah yes, fever. It's been days now, this fever. It just won't break. 

Sweat, lots of sweat. I feel like I've lost weight already. My clothes are too big on me. And headaches... or is it a headache? No, no, I'm sure it's two. One in my neck and the other in my forehead. Nausea... yes, that's what I was trying to remember. It's all those foods I ate last week at the family gathering. The soup was probably not good for me... (pauses) Wait a minute, where did I put my teeth? I swear I had them right here...

Oh dear, muscle pain... it's like someone poured vinegar in my muscles. Can't even move without screaming now. My back's been giving out on me, too. I should really get it checked, maybe get some of those new-fangled mattresses to help with the backache... (trails off)"

(chuckles) Ah yes, Mrs. Johnson! We had some nice conversation about the weather yesterday... anyway...

(Continues)

Headache's been poundin' away like a sledgehammer, and sweatin' buckets, I kid ya not. (pauses to collect thoughts) Now, this nausea business... it's been goin' on for days now, can't even keep nothin' down. Muscles feel like they've been put through a wringer, sore all over. Can't even stand up straight without wincin'. And I thought I had an appointment with that new nurse lady last week? Maybe it was the week before... (trails off)""","Now, doc, I'm tellin' ya... (pauses) Excuse me, what was that show we watched last night? Oh yeah, that new detective one... (chuckles) Anyway, I've been feelin' just terrible, if you know what I mean. My skin's all itchy, like I got a bad case of the hives or somethin'. And then there's these chills, Lord have mercy... (shivers) I'm gettin' cold just thinkin' about 'em.

Now, let me see if I can remember how long this has been goin' on... (pauses) We went to the Early Bird special at Denny's last week, and I was feelin' a bit off then, but I thought it was just from eatin' too much of that fried chicken. (laughs) Oh dear me, that's still got me laughin'. No, no, this is somethin' different... A high fever, that's what the doctor at the pharmacy said I had. And a headache, terrible one. Like someone's bangin' on my head with a hammer.

And then there's this sweatin', like I'm stuck in one of them saunas back home when I was younger. (chuckles) You know, we used to have 'em at the Y... (trails off)

Oh yes! The symptoms! (laughs) Nausea and soreness in my muscles... I think that's it. My stomach's been turnin' somersaults all day. And them aches, they're just killin' me. Can't even lift my arm without wincin'. (pauses) Now, where did we put the remote?"

And my skin, oh boy, it's itchin' somethin' fierce. Can't stop scratchin', makes me crazy! My head's been achin' somethin' awful too... just like when I had that awful sinus infection last year, was it '08? Or was it... um, anyway. 

Felt hot one minute, cold the next. Been sweatin' buckets, but I swear my sheets were soaked this mornin'. Must've been a fever dream. And then there's this nasty stomach cramp, makes me wanna curl up and hide. Oh dear Lord, I'm so tired... (pauses) You know, I was thinkin', we should get some more of them newfangled painkillers for the arthritis...","I don't know if this is what it is, but... I've had this fever for days now.

Ah yes, here they are. Now, what was I saying? Ah yes, fever and chills. And this vomiting business... it's been quite bad, if you know what I mean. Don't want to get into details, but let's just say it's not pleasant.

Now, about the itching. (chuckles) Oh boy, my skin feels like a thousand needles are poking me all over! Can't stop scratching, but that only makes it worse... I remember when I was at the beach last summer and got sunburned something awful. That was quite a pain, too... I wonder if they have any of those after-sun lotions left? You know, for my poor skin?

Headache's been giving me fits, as well. (rubs temples) My head feels like it's going to burst open! And this sweating... good Lord, I'm soaked through the bed sheets every night. Don't even get me started on the nausea. It's like my stomach is trying to turn itself inside out... (laughs nervously) Get up and go to the bathroom, that's what it feels like.

Ache all over, too... muscles, bones, everything. Just feel like an old hunk of junk right now. Don't know how much more I can take."

Hundred four degrees... (pauses) Oh boy, I remember when I used to work in the garden, it would get up that high on a hot summer day. Chills, yeah, those are bad. Like shivers down your spine and all over. Vomiting... (chuckles) Well, let me tell you, my stomach's been acting up since that time I ate that bad chili at the church potluck. Can't remember what year now, but it was a doozy.

And itching... good grief, it feels like someone took a cheese grater to my skin. I've scratched till I'm raw and red. My arm's all scratched up... (pauses) Where did I put that hand cream? Always losing things nowadays...

Now, where were we? Ah yes, symptoms. My head's been pounding something fierce – headache, they call it. Excessive sweating, like after a hot shower or when I'm walking home from the grocery store on a humid day... (trails off) Oh dear, what was I getting at?

Oh yes, nausea and muscle ache... (whispers) I had that before my hip replacement. It was awful. But then again, maybe it wasn't this time? Maybe it's just... uh... allergies? That must be it. (laughs) My goodness!"
299,Malaria,"I've had severe itching, chills, vomiting, and a high fever. I'm also sweating excessively and have a headache.

Like ants crawlin' under my skin. And chills, like I'm freezin' to death, even when it's warm outside. Vomited three times yesterday... or was that the day before? Ah, dear Lord, what a mess. Fever's through the roof, sweatin' like a pig... I swear, I must've gone through half a box of tissues already. Headache's been killin' me, too. Nausea's got me feelin' queasy all the time, and my muscles ache somethin' awful. You know, I was talkin' to Edna at bingo night, and she said her sister had somethin' like this... or maybe it was arthritis? Hmm, what's the difference, anyway?","I've had this itching, you see... it's been going on for a few days now. Severe, I'd say. Can't scratch it enough, no matter how hard I try. And chills, Lord have mercy, it's like I'm cold all the time. No matter what I wear, nothing seems to keep me warm. 

Now, about this vomiting... (pauses) Oh, wait! I remember when my sister had that flu one year. She was always getting sick and throwing up everywhere. We had to take her to the doctor a few times... anyway... yes, the vomiting. It's been happening quite often, if you know what I mean.

Fever, I've got it. High temperature, like 103 degrees or so. My thermometer says that much, but my granddaughter swears it's not that hot. (chuckles) Oh dear, kids these days... always disagreeing with the elderly. 

And sweating! Good grief, it's like a faucet turned on full blast. I've tried to dry myself off, but it just keeps coming back. My poor pillow is all soggy and whatnot.

A headache, you know? Right behind my eyes. Always feels like someone's poking me with a pin. (pauses) Where did I put that recipe book? Ah yes... my mind wanders sometimes...

Nausea... oh dear me! It's been so uncomfortable. Like my stomach's doing flips in an acrobatics show. And muscle pain, Lord have mercy! My back and legs ache something awful. I think it might be from all the gardening I've been doing this spring... (gets distracted) Did I mention my new garden gnome? He's just the most charming thing!

Oh yes! Sorry about that. This itching, it's driving me mad. Do you think it could be related to... umm... was it something I ate? A nice big plate of fried chicken last week... no, wait... (trails off)"
